2120000000/The White Frost has stripped humanity of its luxurious robes. All that's left are beasts that think only of eating and procreating. They are human no longer.
2120000001/Behold the remains of humanity -- ape-men, wretched creatures worthy of disdain. Some my own great grandchildren.
2120000002/Kind of you to recall, considering your role in my death. Once again, you are the good witcher slaying humans with his shining sword.
2120000003/What's the difference? I was human, yet you handed me over to die... No crime without punishment, Geralt. Your time to pay has come.
2120000004/The White Frost revealed their evil. Slay them. They disgust me, too.
2120000005/What about those hairy ape-men? They're humans, left over from a once proud civilization.
2120000006/Their base instincts drive them like the lynch mob from which you saved me. I'm grateful. Take my gift.
2120000007/You haven't changed a bit, wticher. Again, you emerge from nowhere to kill humans.
2120000008/Be cursed!
2120000009/Leave me be!
2120000010/I don't want that.
2120000011/You're here.
2120000012/Who do I spy?
2120000013/Curse you, witcher.
2120000014/CURSE YOU, WHITE WOLF. I CURSE ALL YOU FILTHY MURDERERS. I CURSE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LION-HEADED SPIDER, THE BLACK LEGBA.
2120000015/They'll kill me...
2120000016/I beg you, help me.
2120000017/Thank you, Geralt.
2120000018/They intend to kill us.
2120000019/Hm! I had nothing to do with it.
2120000020/Excellent. Now to prepare the potion...
2120000021/Why ask me?
2120000022/Yes, but this beast is beyond me. Although, I know someone else...
2120000023/The boy Alvin. He's a strong Source and a diviner. What he knows we could not hope to imagine... However, if I were to give him a certain potion...
2120000024/Interested in witches' secrets, are you? The recipe is yours if you swear to take it to your grave.
2120000025/Indeed. I hope you fare just as well with this Beast.
2120000026/Hurry, then.
2120000027/When Alzur approached, the beast asked: "What animal walks on four legs in the morning, on two at noon, and on three in the evening?"
2120000028/Know the answer, witcher?
2120000029/A powerful mage, Alzur was good at riddles. When he answered correctly, the creature attacked. Alzur was able to defeat it and later learned that in solving its riddle, he had drained it of power.
2120000030/If you must.
2120000031/What about your sword? I heard witchers carry two - a silver blade for monsters and steel for humans...
2120000032/Did you think I'd abandon an orphan? Besides, he has potential.
2120000033/With winter approaching, if I grow hungry, I'll eat him. Haha! Doubtless the villagers think so, believing me a monster.
2120000034/Because his heart is as black as those of all the rest!
2120000035/I know of an ointment. When it coats your blade, you'll cause grievous harm, even to specters. The formula will cost you 30 orens.
2120000036/Don't worry. I'm not all bad. The sinner will recover.
2120000037/Leave me in peace!
2120000038/No need to fret, he'll be fine. Bring me the petals of five white myrtle and your questions will be answered. Myrtle grows outside the village. If you lack knowledge of herbs, I have this book. It's yours... for a price.
2120000039/And what do you believe?
2120000040/What do you want?
2120000041/I'll gather my belongings and leave this damnable town. Thanks again.
2120000042/It was his own fault. Many come to me with pitiful fantasies I disdain to fulfill. They take me for a whore, when I am but a witch.
2120000043/Oh my, a witcher. Welcome.
2120000044/The Beast spoke through Alvin, asking "Who summoned me?" The villagers summoned the Beast through their vile deeds. You must find the guilty.
2120000045/So, how would you have answered Alzur's Demon?
2120000046/I hope you fare better with this Beast.
2120000047/Excellent! Do you have the barghest skulls?
2120000048/And take this mandrake root. You might find it useful.
2120000049/Alzur was a mage, a theoretician and practitioner. He traveled broadly, working all the while on a theory of magic. He once encountered a beast immune to all spells. The beast had a lion's body and a man's head.
2120000050/I knew you'd manage it.
2120000051/Yes. Alvin, drink this.
2120000052/Come back later. I'm busy.
2120000053/The Reverend snatched him as he was fetching water.
2120000054/Yes! You don't know what it's like to live here, to endure their evil looks, their whispers, while knowing all their dirty secrets!
2120000055/A few noble deeds and you'll depart. This is my home.
2120000056/We all hide a monster inside us.
2120000057/You can replace the Naezan salt with hellebore petals if you wish.
2120000058/He has powers perhaps beyond his control. For now, he sleeps well with the herbs I brew him.
2120000059/You'll need Naezan salt, Ginatz's acid, wine stone and lard. I can sell you these ingredients.
2120000060/As you wish. By the power of the seven spheres, leave this body. I compel you. Begone!
2120000061/Alvin, go to bed. Geralt... another witcher, Berengar, preceded you. He left these missives...
2120000062/Draw close and listen... Blend two ounces of cadaverine with the myrtle petals. Speak your name backwards, turn about three times leftwards, spit into the fire and stir the potion again.
2120000063/Ha ha ha. I knew witch's magic would be beyond the mind of a man. Grant me a moment to finish the potion.
2120000064/No complaining. Now... SPEAK!
2120000065/Mighty ingredients make mighty spells. Mighty enough for the whole village.
2120000066/Learn for yourself, if you like. We're alone, we have some time...
2120000067/The angry mob has come. "Burn the witch," they cry. "She has summoned the Beast." I must defend myself.
2120000068/I'm not surprised. Honest Mikul violated Ilsa. She took her own life.
2120000069/I've told you my tale. Now you must choose.
2120000070/Don't let them harm me. My sins are not as great as they say.
2120000071/Odo killed his brother for coin. The Reverend exiled his daughter when she became pregnant -- now she whores herself in Vizima. Haren sold a Squirrel to the guards for gold.
2120000072/They trade their gold for poisons and other potions. No business of mine how they're used.
2120000073/Go to them. They wait outside.
2120000074/I'm brewing up another spell, why?
2120000075/Why did you come here, witcher?
2120000076/Fight, Geralt, or we'll both perish! I shall aid you with magic!
2120000077/Thank you, Geralt. I owe you my life. I'll gather my belongings and leave this damnable town.
2120000078/I'm sorry you think so. Farewell.
2120000079/Geralt, what would have happened to me without your aid? I'm glad you found it in yourself to believe me.
2120000080/Thank you. Farewell.
2120000081/You should find yourself a real woman. Everyone knows witches are barren.
2120000082/Would you be so kind and fetch me some pâté?
2120000083/Adda looks divine, even if she's a bit thin for my liking.
2120000084/Master Dandelion is amazing.
2120000085/Silk is out of fashion.
2120000086/About the devourer's teeth? I need ten for a love potion.
2120000087/Lost souls of the dead show a far greater sensitivity than those of the living. Poetic arguments should convince her long enough to see her damned sister.
2120000088/Why would he need a witcher and witch?
2120000089/I could say I read it in some chicken entrails, but the truth is more trite.
2120000090/Greetings again, Geralt.
2120000091/Witches live outside villages, as they always have. You must accept that...
2120000092/Indeed. Like humans ride horses, griggs ride cats. Go to that crypt and recover the harness, then return to me.
2120000093/The entrance lies in the fields. Once inside, look for a small santon, within you should find the harness. Then return here. Can you remember that?
2120000094/I've developed a special ointment, drawing on the old healer's recipe. It makes their cow's coat shine! Hahaha!
2120000095/In truth, I have changed.
2120000096/A certain grigg has fallen in love with me. He informs me of happenings in the area.
2120000097/Unruly griggs, indeed. Doubtless he tried to avenge himself and they've taken offense...
2120000098/The past is past, nothing more...
2120000099/You can trust me.
2120000100/That good-for-nothing... He sealed my chimney, and ever since it's either cold as winter or foggy as fall in here. I wager work on the bridge isn't progressing...
2120000101/I await your catch.
2120000102/In its place, they will leave you a gift of value, symbolizing friendship or joy. If Harn keeps this gift with him, the griggs won't trouble him.
2120000103/Another tribe of griggs inhabits the crypt in the fields. Evil sort, this tribe stole the greatest treasure of our griggs: a cat harness.
2120000104/Thank you.
2120000105/Recover their treasure.
2120000106/In their chapel, which resembles a miniature sculpture of a saint, like the ones they place at crossroads.
2120000107/Go to the old bridge. Leave the cat harness at the nearby small santon. If they accept your gift, they will give you something of value.
2120000108/Good luck, witcher.
2120000109/Return later.
2120000110/I was welcomed with open arms. Their own healer died last winter. If you like, I'll betray to you their greatest secret...
2120000111/They'll play some prank on you.
2120000112/What do you want?
2120000113/Alina's mirror was clearly broken. If you reassemble it and show Alina, the curse may be lifted.
2120000114/That conceited wench? She came to possess a rare and powerful Nehallenia's Mirror, which once served oracles and prophets. Alina consulted her mirror quite frequently...
2120000115/Now take the harness to the chapel of our griggs. It stands just by the bridge - a small, red santon. Return the following day to see if the griggs accepted the gift.
2120000116/What brings you here, for I cannot believe you missed me.
2120000117/No!
2120000118/Nooo!
2120000119/I suffer!
2120000120/So cold...
2120000121/Help!
2120000122/For a moment, I thought she'd come...
2120000123/Your eyes like pansies... sorry, that wasn't to you, I'm writing a poem.
2120000124/Help!
2120000125/Liar. You were jealous of her! Die, murderer!
2120000126/You killed my beloved Alina!
2120000127/They camped nearby, but look like nothing from epic poetry. Ill and starving, many have perished.
2120000128/Entirely. Mr. Tobias sought to help them, but the she-elf leader refused 'human charity'...
2120000129/I strive to compose a love poem for my beloved Alina.
2120000130/He said love would inspire me. He busies himself performing a diversionary maneuver.
2120000131/Ahem. Your hands fine and slender, your hips big and tender, all night and all day, spin my head a painful way...
2120000132/Yes?
2120000133/He's courting the miller's daughter to make Miss Arlene jealous. Clever, that one...
2120000134/What has happened?
2120000135/If you swear never to reveal to anyone, I will impart a terrible secret!
2120000136/Greetings, I'm Adam.
2120000137/Alina meets me daily at noon in the fields. Isn't that romantic?
2120000138/Love is misery...
2120000139/Huh? Is our secret safe?
2120000140/I love her secretly, so you must be discrete. And marriage is never an obstruction to true love.
2120000141/I'm a talentless farmer, a terrible poet and a weak man. I've no place in this world...
2120000142/How am I to look?! My beloved is terrifying people, I killed a woman and I'm a failure!
2120000143/Celina envied Alina, was jealous of Julian and his wealth! She must be punished!
2120000144/I cannot live knowing that my beloved has become a monster. I'll save Alina...
2120000145/Yes?
2120000146/You saved her! Now I must await death for our souls to be reunited.
2120000147/I need to be alone.
2120000148/Celina told me and I couldn't control myself!
2120000149/She confessed! They argued and Celina pushed Alina. My beloved hit her head on a stone... It's too terrible.
2120000150/Ah! Terrible! I must help her.
2120000151/Ohh...
2120000152/She killed my Alina! I'll never see her again!
2120000153/Love is misery...
2120000154/I know what to do. Thank you.
2120000155/Yes?
2120000156/I dream of nothing else.
2120000157/It is I, my love.
2120000158/Yes, love of my life. I could not live knowing you must wander deprived of feelings, er... I mean, as a noonwraith.
2120000159/I have avenged your sister's crime, Alina. We can go now, together, into eternity...
2120000160/Yes, dearest love. I could not live knowing you must wander deprived of feelings, er... I mean, as a noonwraith.
2120000161/It is I, my love.
2120000162/I have avenged your sister's crime, Alina. We can go now, together, into eternity...
2120000163/Geralt...
2120000164/What happened?
2120000165/I... Where am I?
2120000166/Aaaa... My hands... they're covered in blood...! I... killed, murdered so many people... Oooh!
2120000167/Yes, better...
2120000168/Unfortunately not.
2120000169/Oh, Geralt! That terrible Professor - it's his fault. He tricked me, promised me power and glory... I haven't seen any Salamanders since he was killed.
2120000170/He came here once with this repulsive man, Abdul or something... The Professor called him a powerful sorcerer. That's all I know.
2120000171/I remember, through a fog... It was important... I concealed something in the sarcophagus, you must see it.
2120000172/Hold me, Geralt. I feel so cold...
2120000173/I'm cold...
2120000174/Please... I beg you... Don't kill me!
2120000175/I should know, wouldn't you say?
2120000176/Ooo, more fun than a banquet at the New Narakort.
2120000177/We must stop him.
2120000178/You have class, a rare quality. I wish to fight alongside you - call it a whim.
2120000179/The Grand Master is clearly a madman. Even I wouldn't dare pursue a plan like his...
2120000180/Look, Geralt - humans, monsters... easy to mistake one for the other...
2120000181/*sniff* I smell blood...
2120000182/What are you doing?!
2120000183/This is my witcher.
2120000184/Out of my sight!
2120000185/I'm bored. Do something interesting.
2120000186/Do you not know I'm a princess?!
2120000187/A scandalous request! But the last wish is a sacred custom. So be it.
2120000188/Any chance you haven't deduced everything?
2120000189/Sorry, Geralt. The right of state never sleeps.
2120000190/He has been spirited away! Someone will pay for this.
2120000191/My plans remain unchanged. And you won't stop me. I condemn you to death, sentence to be carried out at once!
2120000192/I should have known you'd discover who was behind the counterfeit royal seals. I was wrong to see you merely as a monster slayer.
2120000193/De Wett. I will decide if and when I am offended.
2120000194/De Wett, I know who stands before me. We know each other, do we not, witcher?
2120000195/A princess, indeed, though I do not always feel like one. So many duties... you could not imagine, witcher.
2120000196/Why do you stare? Is my dress displeasing?
2120000197/You shall be summoned when I need you.
2120000198/Silence. It was a nicety. Leave us for now.
2120000199/We no longer desire to speak with you. Step away.
2120000200/Now look to our noble Erkin and the courtiers - the dance grows bolder, fondling and such...
2120000201/You see, witcher, politics is not unlike a tryst.
2120000202/What is your view on politics? To me, politics is like an encounter with a lover. Would you agree?
2120000203/We may speak freely now.
2120000204/Geralt, tell me about witchers. And please don't hide behind your code.
2120000205/It begins with foreplay, glances, conversations - behold that witch with Leuvaarden.
2120000206/Witcher, you may approach. De Wett, fetch me some wine... from that pageboy at the end of the room.
2120000207/I knew it. You cannot fool me, witcher.
2120000208/But look around the room, people whispering in each other's ears, tongues flapping...
2120000209/That doesn't interest me. As a matter of fact, you've spoiled my evening.
2120000210/De Wett, rid us of this intruder!
2120000211/Apology not accepted! Out of my sight. De Wett, we're leaving!
2120000212/So what are you doing here, where everyone meddles and schemes?
2120000213/Then one is consumed by the desire to come together roughly, like animals.
2120000214/Let us explore another topic...
2120000215/Hee hee hee.
2120000216/Go on.
2120000217/Uh, dull. I have grown hungry, and there is naught worth eating at this feast. I tire of partridge tongues and caviar. Hmmm, what do I most desire... I have it!
2120000218/I will answer your ever so dull question if you bring me what I most desire...
2120000219/I am disappointed, witcher. De Wett, we are leaving!
2120000220/Allow me one jest, witcher.
2120000221/A countess said to a count:&#13;
2120000222/- May I ask a riddle, then? &#13;
2120000223/I am forced to study all kinds of nonsense, but books bore me, as does poetry for the most part.
2120000224/Never mind, back to our lovers ambulating about the room.
2120000225/Tongues, tongues, tongues...
2120000226/Finally, one is left with sad, passionless copulation - Velerad and De Wett, for instance.
2120000227/We are adults, Geralt. We both know the desires of men.
2120000228/Do you have something tasty for me?
2120000229/You know how to please a woman.
2120000230/Be swift. My patience is limited.
2120000231/I shall grant you a private audience. Come to my alcove in five minutes. We shall dabble in politics... hee hee hee.
2120000232/Very well. Do not disappoint me again!
2120000233/No, no, no! This is for the riff-raff! Ah, I am so disappointed.
2120000234/Not so hasty... hee hee.
2120000235/King Foltest, my beloved father, treats me like a child, and children dare not dabble in politics. Soon he will see how blind he was. That is all, you may go.
2120000236/I shall answer in due course. But first, I must know if those legends about your "sword" are true...
2120000237/Stop playing games, Geralt. Everything has its limits, including my patience.
2120000238/Begone! I wish to be alone.
2120000239/I expected as much. Shame, our meeting could have been more pleasant. Yet I always keep my word.
2120000240/I should think so.
2120000241/Ahhh, perfect in every way.
2120000242/What are you waiting for? Undress.
2120000243/Finally. "Politics" it shall be, but quietly. We should not be heard...
2120000244/Albedo? Yes, this solution...
2120000245/Take that!
2120000246/I'm innocent! Don't hurt me!
2120000247/Never ever challenge an alchemist.
2120000248/That formula needs rethinking...
2120000249/Do I know you? Ah, distractions... Oh, of course, Geralt.
2120000250/Lovely trophy. Aim to distill it or centrifuge it?
2120000251/Might Rubedo be better?
2120000252/Your just deserts!
2120000253/Oh, greetings.
2120000254/Nothing for you.
2120000255/If you're drawn to the secret arts, especially alchemy, you're certain to want my wares.
2120000256/No, I'm a mere merchant.
2120000257/True... I must find my copy of "Metamorphoses."
2120000258/Don’t dare say a word.
2120000259/Ah, the ore. Perhaps I can finally cause this reaction.
2120000260/Zerrikanian... something about explosive substances.
2120000261/Too expensive. It's nearly iron and very contaminated.
2120000262/Rubbish. Magic and alchemy will disappear from the world. Science alone will remain.
2120000263/What a fool idea to divide substance in the first place!
2120000264/Are you color blind?! I said red meteorite!
2120000265/Why didn't I think of that?
2120000266/True.
2120000267/Take care. No jesting with the catalysis of pyrite.
2120000268/Red meteorite iron ore for my experiments.
2120000269/Even Kalkstein wouldn't promulgate such rubbish. Where have you seen pure Albedo or Nigredo?
2120000270/The last sentence states that in the case of substances, the terms co-dependence and co-existence are interchangeable.
2120000271/By what miracle can the co-dependence of primary substances predicate the possibility of animating inanimate matter, if in this so-called spiral of pseudo-life only five substances find place, while co-existence presupposes the presence of six? Kalkstein contradicts himself!
2120000272/I won't dwell further. Simply put, our argument turns on the essence of matter, the main argument against Kalkstein.
2120000273/Can you imagine such insanity as the concept of substance co-dependence?
2120000274/Not so fast. One more question, which will doubtless baffle you.
2120000275/I wasted a year in seminar. The solution was obvious.
2120000276/Oh, sorry, here's the book.
2120000277/The catalyst worked. An explosion nearly threatened, but once again, the Zerrikanian Masters are shoveling manure.
2120000278/Still here?
2120000279/I never suspected you harbored such intelligence. Accept these books. You'll use them best.
2120000280/Not exactly. Kalkstein states that the motion of the chain has the properties of all three secondary substances comprising the pseudo-life chain, not the primary.
2120000281/I'm a scholar, not an alchemist. I despise superstition.
2120000282/I'm from the University of Oxenfurt. They hired me to improve the composition of the steel in arms production.
2120000283/I once endured a Kalkstein seminar. What a nightmare.
2120000284/I'm developing a philosopher's stone. I'll share with you the gold obtained from the transmutation of lead and throw in free the guarantee of eternal youth.
2120000285/Ha! Raffard the White proved that the chain of pseudo-life can never transpose. Understand?
2120000286/Kalkstein?! We laugh at his pseudo-scientific mumbling. Did you peruse his "Metamorphoses" - hogwash written in cloudy language meant to disguise the author's incompetence.
2120000287/Next time, don't arrive when I'm mixing explosive substances.
2120000288/I attempted to solve the riddle of steel using a worthless Zerrikanian book. I'd gladly swap it for something else.
2120000289/True, I met my wife at a Kalkstein seminar... Poor Maria. Killed by Scoia'tael ...
2120000290/What practical application can Kalkstein's theories have even if legitimate?
2120000291/Here I figured you intelligent. Mutations piqued Kalkstein's interest only recently.
2120000292/Help me!
2120000293/What does he see in her?
2120000294/What do you want?
2120000295/Help!
2120000296/It's unfair...
2120000297/Treacherous vixen...
2120000298/What does that mean?
2120000299/What?
2120000300/NOT_USED
2120000301/Run!
2120000302/Alvin, do exactly as I say. This is important.
2120000303/Run to the inn as fast as you can. And don't look back. Understand?
2120000304/Dogs?
2120000305/We'll fetch you a bit of warm milk and honey. How would you like that?
2120000306/It's not far now. We'll be there soon.
2120000307/Dandelion once sang a love ballad about a witcher.
2120000308/Sadly, my husband-to-be won't adopt Alvin.
2120000309/Good morning.
2120000310/The ballad was romantic... Lovers bound by destiny, unable to meet...
2120000311/The boy is quicksilver, he's everywhere. If he's not in the village, go to the riverbank. Alvin likes it there.
2120000312/I'm to marry soon. What brings you here?
2120000313/Something about ghosts condemned to suffer eternally by unrequited love. It was so...
2120000314/Are witchers like knights, struggling against evil and villainy?
2120000315/Why do you seek me?
2120000316/Yes. He has such beautiful, big eyes...
2120000317/He told some terrible stories. I thought him delirious.
2120000318/If he's not in the village, check the fairytale ruins nearby.
2120000319/Yes. He'll be in the village or helping around the house.
2120000320/Wait, I have a request... If you happen to pass by the inn, would you be kind enough to look in on my fiancé? And perhaps see if my sister Celina can be found anywhere?
2120000321/We're not speaking, he's very irritated. We argued about Alvin.
2120000322/Julian wishes us to have our own children. He wants to send Alvin to the Temple of Melitele or to be trained as a witcher... You'll find him at the tavern.
2120000323/Celina can be unbearable, but she'll change - if she marries. And Julian, well he loves me and no argument can change that.
2120000324/I merely wanted to be sure Julian was well, without him knowing or thinking I was... concerned. Thank you, witcher.
2120000325/You slew another monster! Tell me how!
2120000326/Help me! Help!
2120000327/Ha! I knew you'd return!
2120000328/Would you like to play "Knights"?
2120000329/He he. Is that a joke?
2120000330/I don't want to!
2120000331/I'm cold.
2120000332/They're evil dogs.
2120000333/Very much. Thank you, Caroline.
2120000334/What are those dogs doing?
2120000335/NOT_USED
2120000336/Caroline, I'm tired.
2120000337/The Time of the Sword and Axe approaches
2120000338/The Time of Madness and Disdain...
2120000339/Reborn of Elder Blood, of Hen Ichaer, of a planted seed...
2120000340/A seed that will not sprout but burst into flames!
2120000341/The Time of the White Frost and White Light...
2120000342/The world will perish amidst ice and be reborn with the new sun.
2120000343/Tedd Deireadh, the Final Age.
2120000344/Aaagh... Heeelp!
2120000345/Death, the final judgment. The Beast has met its end once. It doesn't fear death. It is death.
2120000346/Bad children, torturing the witch's puppy again?
2120000347/How will you defeat human villainy? With your sword? You, who died and still walk amongst the living? Who has summoned me?
2120000348/Groarrr!!! Grrrr!!!
2120000349/Innocent blood... evil faces twisted by drink and desire. "Plow her well. Show her you're a man"... blood-stained gold ... the Beast is born! GROAARRORROAAARR!!!"
2120000350/I'm sleepy...
2120000351/It tastes bitter...
2120000352/Abigail... I'm afraid. Why'd they skin the puppy? Why'd they hurt him? He was gentle, he hurt no one. And the girl from outside the village, she screamed, horribly, unlike any human.
2120000353/I shut my eyes and thought hard about fire. Then I heard a hiss and smelled this nasty stench.
2120000354/It worked, because he didn't touch me. I opened my eyes - he stared at me strangely...
2120000355/Caroline would've liked a burial, but not here.
2120000356/I asked why and he tried to whip me.
2120000357/I'll come find you.
2120000358/I had nightmares. I wanted to find you, but found the Reverend . He told me to pray to the Eternal Fire.
2120000359/I was afraid I wouldn't find you!
2120000360/I'm not taking any more yucky medicine.
2120000361/Mommy, where are you?!
2120000362/Oooowww, it hurts!
2120000363/Aaaa! Nooo!
2120000364/Mommy, that hurts...
2120000365/I feel sleepy.
2120000366/Where's Caroline? What happened?
2120000367/You saved me, right?
2120000368/It's all right. I barely knew them.
2120000369/No. My family has passed on.
2120000370/You're really brave.
2120000371/I'm going to be a witcher, too!
2120000372/I wonder what'll happen to me now...
2120000373/Caroline is dead. The dogs ate her.
2120000374/Sometimes my dreams are... strange.
2120000375/I'm off to play - come again...
2120000376/Abigail is kind, but her tea is awful.
2120000377/When I grow up, I'll also wear a ponytail.
2120000378/That's a great sword.
2120000379/Going to market tomorrow.
2120000380/I'm going to be a witcher when I grow up.
2120000381/Triss said it wasn't a nice shed anyway...
2120000382/Geralt, teach me to swordfight.
2120000383/I have trouble with the Power and I destroyed a shed...
2120000384/I'll tell Shani you were bad.
2120000385/You look like the Reverend returning from the cellar...
2120000386/Yaaawn... what's the time?
2120000387/You're bad... I could hug him...
2120000388/She doesn't let me eat sweets!
2120000389/I don't want to attend Oxenfurt University. And Shani said...
2120000390/But I want to learn how to fight!
2120000391/Pictures are stupid!
2120000392/I don't like you or Triss!
2120000393/Shani and I played pick-up sticks today! I won!
2120000394/Triss has made me look at stupid pictures!
2120000395/I want a puppy...
2120000396/Delicious! Thank you!
2120000397/You won't hit me will you?
2120000398/I won't! You'll see!
2120000399/I want candy!!!
2120000400/Are they dead?
2120000401/I understand, Geralt. Take me away from here.
2120000402/I'm glad you're here!
2120000403/Heeeeeeelp! I don't want to go...
2120000404/I want my mommy!!!
2120000405/ZzzZZzzzzZZzzz.....
2120000406/And then Alina found me! I'm not lying!
2120000407/No, the man in glasses started crying and the others were afraid to get close to her while she called them bad names...
2120000408/Hi, Geralt. I have a new home! It's nicer than Vizima was, it's just that I missed you...
2120000409/I do! Are we going to kill monsters together?
2120000410/...And then she kicked him between the legs and he strated crying and the others were afraid to get close to her because she started casting spells.
2120000411/She said she teleported me to a friend in Kovir, where the air is clean and there are many things to do...
2120000412/I found a wounded dog. Shani says we should care for those who get hurt.
2120000413/Take that! I'm the Grand Master, an invincible knight!
2120000414/Then more men came through the windows on ropes. They got Triss and beat her, I think... And a man in glasses asked her where I was.
2120000415/Shani cussed and kicked him in the...
2120000416/I won't go back there! They'll hurt me! Triss should come here.
2120000417/I was scared, more than in the outskirts. I shut my eyes and imagined I was far away from those people, somewhere beautiful with the sun shining...
2120000418/I heard heavy footsteps on the stairs. Then Triss got angry at those men, angrier than she was when I colored her dress with magic paint that is only seen in the dark...
2120000419/I'll be good. I promise...
2120000420/Now do you see the necessity of this action, no matter the price? Geralt, open your mind.
2120000421/Yes?
2120000422/Would you want to live with ordinary people? Witchers protect people like these: simple, defenseless, normal...
2120000423/The one in glasses said something about playing with her and Triss said you would find him and kill him...
2120000424/Shani screamed at the man in glasses. He told her she liked freaks and he'd show her what a real man was...
2120000425/I wear it constantly.
2120000426/I dream about Alina. I see her in the fields, dancing in sunlight, searching. She tells me to help but I know we won't find anything. When I wake, I can't breathe and feel bad.
2120000427/Not when I nap during the day, but at night... I have strange dreams.
2120000428/Dh'oine! Look into my eyes - see your death.
2120000429/I promise. There are elves around here. One is really beautiful; but she argued with Mr. Tobias... Can we play "Kill the elf"?
2120000430/I heard cries and people falling down the stairs and I smelled burnt meat...
2120000431/I don't need to hear this. You're not even human.
2120000432/I really like that game. I always win, well, almost...
2120000433/I was learning the Elder Language with Triss, there was a terrible storm. Then Triss told me to hide under the bed...
2120000434/I was playing with Shani when they came in. The leader had glasses and used strange words I couldn't understand...
2120000435/Okay, I'll stop.
2120000436/I know.
2120000437/Then someone ordered the room to be searched and they found me...
2120000438/They put a sack on my head and led me somewhere...
2120000439/I don't want to go back there, Geralt!
2120000440/The hermit told me they were magic. Triss said I'd learn to cast spells someday. I like magic.
2120000441/Necklaces are for girls...
2120000442/An amulet like yours!
2120000443/You saved me! I was scared...
2120000444/It's not Alina. All the kids play it. I'm always the Grand Master...
2120000445/Hey, Geralt. These fields are great to play in.
2120000446/I ran and they chased me and I was running soo fast, but then I tripped and they caught me.
2120000447/Geralt, take me with you. I'll be good.
2120000448/Yes?
2120000449/I'll remember that. Geralt, something bad is about to happen. I can feel it.
2120000450/Yes, I wear it all the time. I don't want to hear them... Geralt, why are the elves doing this?
2120000451/No... I feel strange... I... can hear what they're thinking. It's terrible, Geralt.
2120000452/The Reverend looks after me now.
2120000453/I have to go. The Reverend will be angry.
2120000454/The Time of the White Frost. The Time of the White Light. The Time of Madness. The Time of Disdain. The time comes.
2120000455/It's my chance to become a decent man.
2120000456/Abigail was a bad influence, the Reverend says.
2120000457/When I'm a man, I'll become a knight.
2120000458/That's what he says...
2120000459/The Reverend plucked me from a witch's claws.
2120000460/I should pray so that demons don’t haunt me.
2120000461/The Reverend says the Eternal Fire saved me, but I'm certain it was you.
2120000462/Sometimes I'm rather naughty.
2120000463/I just wanted to use the Power, like Triss...
2120000464/Hmmm, knights are worthy, too... I know, I'll be a witcher-knight. Geralt, you're great. Will you play with me now?
2120000465/That stinks...
2120000466/Too bad, that would be really nice...
2120000467/I'm not sure, then.
2120000468/Sure! One like you, not like Berengar. Witchers are so brave. They never grow ill.
2120000469/I dreamt I was a witcher fighting this monster and I wasn't afraid at all!
2120000470/No. Can't I become a witcher without that?
2120000471/Villagers say Berengar's afraid to kill some giant fish. Not you! I want to be a witcher!
2120000472/I want them to like me. I don't want them to die... What should I do?
2120000473/I always feel better talking to you.
2120000474/So many fear me. When they think I can't hear, they call me the devil's child.
2120000475/I'll remember that.
2120000476/Geralt!
2120000477/I hear voices... from all those women who live here.
2120000478/Why did Alina's soul refuse to leave? I can sense her happiness now that she's thinking about her wedding. She doesn't know she's a ghost.
2120000479/I know! You love Triss!
2120000480/That's sad. You should fall in love.
2120000481/I know! You love Shani.
2120000482/Geralt, do you love someone?
2120000483/I heard a story of a noonwraith who wouldn't wed a Nilfgaardian... But I don't remember how it ended.
2120000484/Hi, Geralt!
2120000485/I'm not telling! I'll walk with you.
2120000486/That was some neat sword work!
2120000487/That wall looks pretty thin. Maybe we can break it down.
2120000488/I overheard them saying we'd be taken to Vizima.
2120000489/The Reverend sent me to this deserted house. He said someone would be waiting there for me...
2120000490/Follow me.
2120000491/I fear these elves will murder us all! Save us, Master Geralt!
2120000492/Run for your life!
2120000493/Help!
2120000494/Maybe I should meet him?
2120000495/Hm... Handsome...
2120000496/Should I...?
2120000497/Are you crazy?!
2120000498/It's drizzling.
2120000499/I don't like this weather.
2120000500/It's finally raining!
2120000501/Finally, rain.
2120000502/By the gods! Don't hurt me!
2120000503/Protect me, Melitele!
2120000504/Oh, my back.
2120000505/What a stench.
2120000506/These are uncertain times.
2120000507/Why would I need this?
2120000508/Terrible weather.
2120000509/Hope it doesn't rain any harder.
2120000510/Wretched weather.
2120000511/Raining so hard I can't see anything.
2120000512/Save me, people!
2120000513/Oh oh oh...
2120000514/My old bones...
2120000515/Ugh, I don't have the strength anymore.
2120000516/Run for your life!
2120000517/What were you thinking?!
2120000518/It's drizzling.
2120000519/It rains and it pours.
2120000520/Hasn't rained hard in a while.
2120000521/Everything's soaked.
2120000522/The Butcher of Blaviken's in town. If you see him, run!!
2120000523/How rude!
2120000524/My seamstress sewed it with imported fabric.
2120000525/I doubt it. Many merchants have fled.
2120000526/So they say.
2120000527/A mercenary turned servant of the Order.
2120000528/Her fight against the Scoia'tael destroyed her.
2120000529/Don't be ridiculous. Impossible!
2120000530/It's a warning.
2120000531/Perhaps you should find work.
2120000532/Why waste my breath?
2120000533/What a silly dream!
2120000534/Tomorrow you'll forget all about it.
2120000535/Thanks.
2120000536/Yours suits you.
2120000537/I apologize for my temper.
2120000538/Indeed.
2120000539/I must find the sorceress to buy ointment that turns women into goddesses.
2120000540/Someone was mugged beneath my window!
2120000541/Such impertinence!
2120000542/You foreigners understand naught.
2120000543/That of the Lady of the Lake, our good guardian.
2120000544/Nothing of the sort. The Lady is a good spirit.
2120000545/I'm an old woman.
2120000546/You cityfolk are charmers.
2120000547/What say you?
2120000548/You toy with me.
2120000549/Follow the road along the fences to the tavern.
2120000550/You'll find no better, even in Bullsville. A widely respected widow runs it.
2120000551/Quite welcome. Now to my chores.
2120000552/A witcher? An occupation unworthy of honest men.
2120000553/Shake hands with fishfolk? I think not!
2120000554/You've doubtless traversed the world, so my question should not surprise, though it may sound strange.
2120000555/It's nice of you to want to help...
2120000556/I needed a shawl. Nothing else.
2120000557/As long as you keep it a secret, I'll give you the recipe for White Honey I stole from the baker.
2120000558/If the Wild Hunt appeared in the heavens, we should ready ourselves for misfortune.
2120000559/Exactly the shawl I need!
2120000560/I wish to fetch my daughter a splendid frock for her wedding. Where might I find a beautiful shawl to complement it?
2120000561/Thank you! My daughter... the most beautiful bride in the world!
2120000562/Ginatia, or moon rose, resembles the wild rose. Legend tells that it grows where falling stars landed. Herbalists find use for ginatia petals.
2120000563/He wanted me to betray the secret of lovage. Seems a local lass caught his eye. The herb must have reminded him of you. As you tend to our monsters, I'll gladly help.
2120000564/Though very rare, honeysuckle grows especially in fields. Its leaves likewise resemble ivy. Examine them closely to find their use.
2120000565/Of course, the berberk tree bears dark fruit that helps prepare infusions.
2120000566/Wonderful, but don't think me a witch. I know what any wise woman knows.
2120000567/If we pour a sorcerer's poisons into the lake, our troubles with the fishpeople will end.
2120000568/He's not made any sugar dolls since...
2120000569/My mother always said: pawn what you must to show you are best. I must have that shawl or the wedding will fail.
2120000570/To the city then, though I fear the dangerous roads.
2120000571/Dandelion wished that I tell you about the local herbs. He said you may need them for potions.
2120000572/Run!
2120000573/Help!
2120000574/Vile place.
2120000575/Shoo, fly!
2120000576/I'm bored.
2120000577/Are you daft?!
2120000578/It's raining.
2120000579/Rained on again.
2120000580/Everything's wet.
2120000581/Torrential.
2120000582/No monsters here.
2120000583/Hmm.
2120000584/Expecting applause?
2120000585/Let me be!
2120000586/I know...
2120000587/Splendid.
2120000588/What's that?
2120000589/No, please don't!
2120000590/Why would I need this?
2120000591/It's raining.
2120000592/It could stop raining.
2120000593/Raining cats and dogs.
2120000594/I detest this weather.
2120000595/Something devoured my neighbor's husband last moon! Nobody takes on the monsters in this city...
2120000596/How rude!
2120000597/I wish to move to the Temple Quarter.
2120000598/Monsters in the streets!
2120000599/I'll not speak with you.
2120000600/Are you a cultist or a pig?
2120000601/I'll help.
2120000602/Why do you gaze at me?
2120000603/Definitely.
2120000604/Why ask that?
2120000605/The neighbors mentioned Triss Merigold is in town.
2120000606/Shove off!
2120000607/Then I'll help.
2120000608/Why do you gaze at me?
2120000609/Certain.
2120000610/Why ask that?
2120000611/My man continually complains that vodka's scarce.
2120000612/Nothing I haven't said.
2120000613/Hm.
2120000614/Saw one like you recently and asked the reverend. Never learned his name, but he wished to enter the city.
2120000615/You a witcher?
2120000616/He spoke with the Reverend then took his leave. He seemed... fearful.
2120000617/I know little.
2120000618/Where it's from is my business.
2120000619/I know not. He approached the Reverend, perhaps for help.
2120000620/You smelling or buying?
2120000621/Fresh meat!
2120000622/Accursed beggars!
2120000623/Delicious meat here!
2120000624/Fresh supply of meat!
2120000625/Someone should deal with these vagrants.
2120000626/Greetings, Geralt. Have you met Rayla? A singular transformation gave her the gift of life...
2120000627/Rayla, darling, you won't permit this mongrel to insult your master?
2120000628/Better than alive... perfect. You'll learn that soon enough.
2120000629/As you wish. Behold my koshchay! The perfect killer!
2120000630/Rayla always admired you. Shame, you might have made a good couple...
2120000631/This time you've pissed in a tornado... Kill him!
2120000632/How irritating. You just cut up my koshchay, the result of much labor... Now to resolve this matter through more traditional means...
2120000633/My, how threatening that sounded. I warned you pissing upwind leads to disaster...
2120000634/Triss Merigold is being dragged to the laboratories as we speak. Torture will follow. Everyone breaks sooner or later. It's merely a question of time...
2120000635/I learned long ago only to rely on myself. Before I kill you, you must know...
2120000636/What say you, witcher? Still the indifferent tough guy?
2120000637/Allar Zarh Bin Talla!
2120000638/A heavily armed unit will kill all wounded in the hospital and make that red-headed bitch watch. After they rape her, she will wish to die, but it will be far too late. We'll give her mutagens and see what happens...
2120000639/Coward, you know the punishment you face. You can evade it by slaying Geralt of Rivia. You may earn my mercy...
2120000640/You may weaken me, but you'll die anyway!
2120000641/Berengar's amulet? You have Berengar's amulet?!
2120000642/Kill him. Now.
2120000643/You're in deep shit.
2120000644/No!
2120000645/Retreat!
2120000646/I'll tear you to pieces.
2120000647/Halt immediately.
2120000648/Follow me!
2120000649/Make him suffer.
2120000650/Your tricks are for naught.
2120000651/Clever... From you, of course. He was getting close, and you trusted him. I would've been foolish not to take advantage of the situation.
2120000652/I needed you to open the tower. I don't need you anymore.
2120000653/The detective was onto me and you trusted him, so I killed him and assumed his identity. Two birds with one stone.
2120000654/Professor, you know the way. Get to it.
2120000655/I found it. We have what we came for.
2120000656/Professor, deal with those witchers.
2120000657/You tremble, yet you complained Savolla would have them all, leaving none for you...
2120000658/Did the sight of a single witcher, White Wolf himself, instill fear?
2120000659/Time is essential! I wield the power of the Circle of Elements, they are no threat!
2120000660/Back to work. I want the mutagens ready for teleportation in 15 minutes. Our witchers shan't trouble us!
2120000661/Indeed. Tend to your tasks in the Trade Quarter.
2120000662/He must have left a different way. No matter.
2120000663/Professor, cut the crap and get him!
2120000664/Silence! Back to the base in the Trade Quarter. Hurry, before he recovers.
2120000665/The venom of Zerrikanian scorpions - lethal even to mutants.
2120000666/You were never a threat.
2120000667/Salamandra is not evil. Not more than those with the will to shape their own fate!
2120000668/You won't surprise me this time... Now DIE!
2120000669/Foltest impregnated his own sister and let his offspring eat the city's inhabitants for years.
2120000670/Salamandra is not evil. Not more than those with the will to shape their own fate!
2120000671/White Wolf. We've been expecting you.
2120000672/Salamandra is not evil. Not more than those with the will to shape their own fate!
2120000673/Even Siegfried of Denesle would follow you into fire. All is aligning with the Grand Plan. Should you demonstrate wisdom, you'll see it realized...
2120000674/Furthermore, during the war, he allowed Nilfgaard to plunder and torch neighboring allied kingdoms.
2120000675/The future. Evolution or destiny...
2120000676/You go after your goal no matter what... The elves you brought are doomed to die.
2120000677/Who are you fighting for? Foltest? A monarch with more sins on his conscience than Professor has words in his vocabulary?
2120000678/If not Foltest, then who? The Lodge of the Sorceresses? You know not what those bitches do to influence postwar treaties. The resettlements, deportations, the unresolved matter of the Scoia'tael, and others...
2120000679/Hahaha! I underestimated you in the swamp, but you won't surprise me now.
2120000680/The country is ruled by a degenerate monarch who allowed his monstrous daughter to murder citizens for years.
2120000681/Furthermore, during the war, he allowed Nilfgaard to plunder and torch neighboring allied kingdoms.
2120000682/If not Foltest, then who? The Lodge of the Sorceresses? You know not what those bitches do to influence postwar treaties. The resettlements, deportations, the unresolved matter of the Scoia'tael, and others...
2120000683/Remember the magic book from the Tower in the swamp? Observe some spells...
2120000684/Remember the magic book from the Tower in the swamp? Observe some useful spells...
2120000685/The future. Evolution or destiny...
2120000686/The elven race is condemned. Humans only accelerate the inevitable. If you demonstrate wisdom, you'll see the Grand Plan.
2120000687/Nothing will change, except there'll be one witcher less.
2120000688/The Grand Plan foresees all possibilities. Join us or stop being an obstacle...
2120000689/Furthermore, during the war, he allowed Nilfgaard to plunder and torch neighboring allied kingdoms.
2120000690/If not Foltest, then who? The Lodge of Sorceresses? You know not what those bitches did to influence postwar treaties. The resettlements, deportations, the unresolved matter of the Scoia'tael, and others...
2120000691/Don't make me laugh, Geralt. Simplicity suits you like a fist in the nose and sentimentality suits you even less. You can't deny that. You're too smart. Besides, who do you want to defend? Foltest? A monarch with more sins on his conscience than the Professor has long words in his vocabulary?
2120000692/Hahaha! You've learned nothing from our last meeting.
2120000693/Foltest impregnated his own sister and let his offspring eat the city's inhabitants for years.
2120000694/The future. Evolution or destiny...
2120000695/You're fighting for a cause in the name of vague principles. You're in a labyrinth of other people's schemes. You don't know the Grand Plan.
2120000696/You go after your goal no matter what... The elves you brought are doomed to die.
2120000697/Even Siegfried of Denesle would follow you into fire. All is aligning with the Grand Plan. Should you demonstrate wisdom, you'll see it realized...
2120000698/The elven race is condemned. Humans only accelerate the inevitable. If you demonstrate wisdom, you'll see the Grand Plan.
2120000699/Nothing will change, except we'll have one witcher less.
2120000700/The Grand Plan foresees all possible resolutions. Join us or stop being an obstacle...
2120000701/You're fighting for a cause in the name of vague principles. You're in a labyrinth of other people's schemes. You don't know the Grand Plan.
2120000702/The country is ruled by a degenerate monarch who allowed his monstrous daughter to murder citizens for years.

2120000707/The future. Evolution or destiny...
2120000708/The book in the swamp contained some interesting spells...
2120000709/Including Alzur's Shield, which even Professor can use to destroy you. Observe.
2120000710/Goodbye, Geralt.
2120000711/How?!! Alzur's Shield! Professor, tend to him, I have no counter spells.
2120000712/I never expected so little challenge from a witcher. Professor, let's go while the barrier still stands.
2120000713/It is equally difficult to love and not love.
2120000714/Spring will grace roads with pouring rains,
2120000715/No changes in view -- it is what they felt;
2120000716/Helping us keep the hope that remains
2120000717/Allowing our hearts the sun's warmth to admire,
2120000718/When led by lust, we feel set above,
2120000719/Yet our thoughts trick us and sweeten all.
2120000720/Tears of diamonds on your lashes sink.
2120000721/The sense of words is gone in a blink.
2120000722/Both shine within us and spell our downfall.
2120000723/Alive with the heat of the Eternal Fire.
2120000724/... The first scents of autumn can be smelt-
2120000725/Sir, do not interrupt my thoughts.
2120000726/Our Merciful Master will see you now, sir. Go upstairs to his chambers.
2120000727/Yes?
2120000728/Are you ready, sir?
2120000729/Nonsense. Everyone knows Geralt married a sorceress and they live somewhere on the happy isles.
2120000730/Greetings, stranger. Funny, you remind me of someone.
2120000731/That famous witcher, Geralt, the White Wolf.
2120000732/Master Dandelion, the bard of bards, has sung those ballads for years.
2120000733/It's uncanny. White hair, sword across your back, straight out of the ballads.
2120000734/Many must mistake you for Geralt.
2120000735/Look ye yonder, a wolf dances in the wood,&#13;
2120000736/Art soothes the soul, doesn't it? But I also need to eat. How about a contribution? Five orens.
2120000737/No wonder pretty lasses are so sublime.&#13;
2120000738/A sorceress bit viciously by serpents cold and vile,&#13;
2120000739/Shall I sing for you, my lord?
2120000740/You'll not get one note from me!
2120000741/Look yonder, toward the forest, where a wolf happily dances&#13;
2120000742/No wonder pretty lasses are so sublime.&#13;
2120000743/A sorceress bit viciously by serpents cold and vile,&#13;
2120000744/I must refuse.
2120000745/Wooo.
2120000746/No one appreciates art here.
2120000747/Oh.
2120000748/Am I a street player with bagpipes?
2120000749/No one buys art for pennies!
2120000750/No thanks.
2120000751/Hm.
2120000752/I'm sure it'll bring someone joy.
2120000753/Tasteless.
2120000754/Laymen.
2120000755/One more shot and I'll bid my last meal farewell.
2120000756/Don't kill me.
2120000757/Mercy!
2120000758/Monster! I tremble...
2120000759/Magnificent - worthy of a beautiful lyric.
2120000760/I'll compose an epic song of the witcher battling the Beast!
2120000761/I once heard a ballad about a witcher...
2120000762/Shall I sing?
2120000763/Ungh.
2120000764/So loud...
2120000765/What a dump.
2120000766/Would you care to hear a beautiful ballad?
2120000767/A real art lover!
2120000768/I'm too young to die!
2120000769/Who will help?!
2120000770/No.
2120000771/...A maiden on a bear. Ridiculous coat of arms.
2120000772/...the king won't be pleased...
2120000773/...acting against procedures...
2120000774/Someone else might agree, but not me.
2120000775/It's raining.
2120000776/Rain again?
2120000777/Wasting my words.
2120000778/What a downpour.
2120000779/Run for your life!
2120000780/This outfit's uncomfortable.
2120000781/Carry on.
2120000782/A bed, that's what I need.
2120000783/No!
2120000784/I appreciate the thought, but no.
2120000785/Drizzle.
2120000786/I dislike this weather.
2120000787/It's raining.
2120000788/It's raining, clearly.
2120000789/I'm too young to die!
2120000790/What have I achieved? Oh, woe!
2120000791/Who will help me?!
2120000792/Ah, life.
2120000793/I don't belong here.
2120000794/Old and gray but foolish as ever.
2120000795/It's really raining.
2120000796/Raining again.
2120000797/No use talking about it.
2120000798/What a storm.
2120000799/Mhm...
2120000800/I love this tune.
2120000801/You people are monsters! Stand aside! I'll save her myself!
2120000802/The avant-garde... I hate it...
2120000803/Too experimental, melodic laxity...
2120000804/My master dislikes me, whereas my lady adores me.
2120000805/No rascal greater than a butler!
2120000806/And they said a simple villager couldn't build a career in the city.
2120000807/Pray don't track in any mud!
2120000808/This threshold's too high for witchers' legs.
2120000809/Did you wipe your feet?
2120000810/My grandfather was a valet, my father a butler, and I followed in their footsteps.
2120000811/Leave me be!
2120000812/Don't interrupt.
2120000813/I'll compose a rhyme of your fine qualities if you reveal your name.
2120000814/All lads and lasses know very well, no warrior stands greater than Yaevinn the elf!
2120000815/I won't speak with you.
2120000816/What wit. Yaevinn cannot set foot in Vizima as long as the Order of the Flaming Rose watches over it.
2120000817/Fool.
2120000818/A virtuous Siegfried swore his sacred vows to elicit the love of a damsel proud.
2120000819/What luck. That even rhymes with generous!
2120000820/The last witcher perished in vain, while monsters were drinking champaign.
2120000821/You, that famed knight? Impossible!
2120000822/What bold warrior is this? 'Tis Erasmus the Generous!
2120000823/Indeed.
2120000824/What audacity, claiming to be the legendary White Wolf!
2120000825/Amazing.
2120000826/Would you care to support the arts?
2120000827/Welcome to Lord Leuvaarden's feast.
2120000828/Don't kill me!
2120000829/Help!
2120000830/You're growing beautifully.
2120000831/Grow, my lovelies.
2120000832/What's this, plant lice?
2120000833/Ha, I'm reminded of my fighting days.
2120000834/You don't look like a seed supplier.
2120000835/I refuse.
2120000836/Lovely weather.
2120000837/Replenishing weather.
2120000838/Want something?
2120000839/I'm getting wet.
2120000840/What a downpour.
2120000841/Mercy!
2120000842/Ah, life.
2120000843/Curses.
2120000844/Society made me what I am.
2120000845/I'm innocent!
2120000846/Stop pestering me!
2120000847/I hate when it rains.
2120000848/Can't see a thing,
2120000849/Why couldnt' rain be made of ale?
2120000850/It rains and it pours...
2120000851/Not so often anymore. Though it's all I have left now that the women are less willing.
2120000852/Begone! I'm no beggar!
2120000853/Then the larvae eat your brain and crawl out your eyes once they mature into flies... Disgusting. Many of us died thus. There were also diseases, venomous spiders and snakes, and many other afflictions I can't even name.
2120000854/There you are.
2120000855/Any specific color?
2120000856/For a bite to eat. Thank you.
2120000857/Look how they grow...
2120000858/My garden brings joy. When Melitele decides my time has come, I will go happily.
2120000859/This hospital garden demands a caring hand.
2120000860/Like it? I love plants and know them well. I spent my life dealing in bloodshed. Now's my chance for peace and quiet.
2120000861/Bring me a morsel to eat and we'll talk.
2120000862/It is no point of pride, but I long earned my living as a mercenary. Those times are behind me now and here I am content.
2120000863/Good luck on the Path!
2120000864/Excellent. Here's your gold.
2120000865/There you are.
2120000866/You look like a warrior - care to kill echinops for me?
2120000867/Five years ago, there was a battle near Brenna. When the dust had settled, our men had beaten the Nilfgaardians. We ceased to call ourselves an imperial province that day.
2120000868/Too true. We could take on anyone. I saw half the world as a member of Pretty Kitty's corps of mercenaries. We even went to Zerrikania.
2120000869/I was sure I'd win. Beware, the sharp one plays well.
2120000870/Bring their thorns as proof.
2120000871/There you are.
2120000872/I gave my word the sword would find another witcher. As he lay dying, he mumbled about teeth and destiny. Then he laughed -- at his own death.
2120000873/It was hell. Hot as an oven and humid as a bathhouse. We massacred the natives while Zerrikania massacred us. They have flies there that creep up your nose at night and lay eggs...
2120000874/I knew one of you would come by eventually.
2120000875/Yes. It was witcher Cöen's. A strapping fellow and a rare breed... Not very talkative, mind you.
2120000876/Thank you for the meal, but I don't know what else to tell you.
2120000877/During the war, I served as a mercenary under Pretty Kitty herself. You have heard what a warrior she was, what a woman...
2120000878/I even saw a striped horse... After almost eight months of fighting in the jungle, we had to retreat. Impossible to win a war if you can't locate your enemy. It was the only defeat Pretty Kitty ever suffered.
2120000879/Mmm, delicious! Amazing how honest toil can stir the appetite. Thank you, witcher.
2120000880/I kept it hidden for five years. I lost hope I'd ever run into another witcher. Miss Shani knew Cöen. She works at the hospital.
2120000881/Around that corner! Something moved! Likely monsters again!
2120000882/Watch for bandits. With our stink, they harm us not, but those with full purses...
2120000883/I feel strange. See any sores? Perhaps I have the plague.
2120000884/The city guards avoid us... who will protect us?
2120000885/I'm innocent.
2120000886/Wonder who squealed...
2120000887/You tasted the muck they call supper?
2120000888/This is Arnold, my rat.
2120000889/Watch what you say. The walls have ears.
2120000890/I may be a thief, but society's to blame.
2120000891/Third month inside so I've grown accustomed. Better than home.
2120000892/I'll appeal to King Foltest himself.
2120000893/Step away. We're honest thieves, not politicals.
2120000894/Not much time left!
2120000895/Aaa...ugh...ugh
2120000896/Anesthetic! Please!
2120000897/White cold will soon engulf the world!
2120000898/Spare some booze?
2120000899/I detest those Viziman bandits.
2120000900/My leg rots...
2120000901/Where are the orphans from the abandoned houses?
2120000902/Whadda wimp... sheesh.
2120000903/Share your wine...?
2120000904/Why do you ignore me?
2120000905/Okay, I'll go.
2120000906/One of you snatched my knife.
2120000907/Where can I find more wine?
2120000908/This hole is taken.
2120000909/Don't kill me!
2120000910/Oof, I took you for one of those elven madmen.
2120000911/I'll remain poor no matter who wins.
2120000912/I'm starving. Anything to spare?
2120000913/I'll share what I know about garkains...
2120000914/Thank you.
2120000915/Sir, help somone who's suffered due to war.
2120000916/The diseased were cremated, yet people still fear the plague.
2120000917/Shani's a fine-looking wench.
2120000918/The butcher woman's meat tastes bad.
2120000919/I hadn't expected so many children to die from the plague.
2120000920/Sometimes on the waterfront at night. Destroy him.
2120000921/Bigger and stronger than drowners. A criminal drowns, sometimes he turns into the drowned dead.
2120000922/Blinded by rage, he desires to drag all living into the water.
2120000923/No, they're smaller. This was a drowned dead.
2120000924/I recently saw a drowned dead by the river's edge.
2120000925/Sir, you look a witcher to me.
2120000926/A she-monster prowls around here. Great teeth and claws, kills people. And none can slay her.
2120000927/What will tomorrow bring? I shudder to think.
2120000928/I'm just a simple poor man!
2120000929/Damnable plague...
2120000930/To hell with everyone!
2120000931/I'm... dying...
2120000932/Don't touch me!
2120000933/I appreciate that.
2120000934/I needn't bathe for a month.
2120000935/Hmm...
2120000936/Slashing like a seasoned killer.
2120000937/Couldn't it rain beer?
2120000938/Hope they kill each other off.
2120000939/Mercy!
2120000940/Ruins...
2120000941/Curse the nonhumans and the Order!
2120000942/Away! Don't touch me!
2120000943/Don't mock me.
2120000944/I won't need to bathe for the next month.
2120000945/Ah, let it rain.
2120000946/Slashing like a seasoned killer.
2120000947/Doesn't look like it'll end any time soon.
2120000948/I'm just a simple poor man!
2120000949/I'm starving.
2120000950/My throat's dry.
2120000951/...what could we?...
2120000952/Away! Don't touch me!
2120000953/Your jest is unkind.
2120000954/I won't need to bathe for the next month.
2120000955/Ah, let it rain.
2120000956/It's thumping.
2120000957/Slashing like a seasoned killer.
2120000958/Don't hurt me!
2120000959/A tad tired.
2120000960/Old age is no joke.
2120000961/What was I supposed to do?
2120000962/Halt!
2120000963/I really don't need that.
2120000964/Plants need rain.
2120000965/Lovely downpour.
2120000966/Look at this rain.
2120000967/Ah, rain!
2120000968/Don't kill the gravedigger!
2120000969/Oo, a little shallow, darlin'.
2120000970/Two ditches more...
2120000971/Ashes to ashes...
2120000972/People like you keep me in business.
2120000973/Here to reserve a plot?
2120000974/Recently buried something like your trophy.
2120000975/Away! Don't touch me!
2120000976/Kidding?
2120000977/I won't need to bathe for the next month.
2120000978/Slashing rain like a seasoned killer.
2120000979/I'd prefer if it rained beer...
2120000980/Doesn't look like it'll end any time soon.
2120000981/Thief, right, and I'm here with the politicals... scandalous!
2120000982/Hey, lemme outta here, I'm innocent. Those five pounds of fisstech were for personal use... Hey you, jailer! At least move me. I don't wanna be with the politicals. Politics makes you rot! I'm a decent thief, lemme out...
2120000983/Elves set my neighbors' home ablaze and cut them to bits. I've decided to flee the city.
2120000984/Rightly so. Know what I'll tell you?
2120000985/Worry no further.
2120000986/You come here daily, but I've not seen him. Perhaps he's recovered.
2120000987/Take me as your squire. I can carry a sword.
2120000988/I've had naught to eat in three days.
2120000989/Around that corner! Something moved! Likely monsters again!
2120000990/Spare some coin?
2120000991/I'd need Captain Meis's permission.
2120000992/Is that possible?
2120000993/Sometimes I inform Raymond about the more interesting dead men.
2120000994/A partnership. With those swords you doubtless lop off a few heads occasionally...
2120000995/City authorities prohibited it.
2120000996/Makes sense. Maybe we can do business...
2120000997/It'll be there by evening.
2120000998/How?! I spoke to him recently!
2120000999/What do you need?
2120001000/Here're the keys. Go inside, where we lay the fresh ones. But if they kill you, don't return to haunt me.
2120001001/Where you want the body dumped?
2120001002/For a bottle of dwarven liquor.
2120001003/Nothing like a good drink!
2120001004/Resourceful! It's just a job.
2120001005/Why would you come to a gravedigger? So I ask you: who will you be burying? Fear not, my prices are reasonable.
2120001006/When you dispatch another soul, let me know and you'll earn a share from the coffin.
2120001007/What'll it be? Pine, or oak perhaps? An entire crypt? Let's see, five ells wide...
2120001008/They reopened it recently. But take care...
2120001009/Yes?
2120001010/I want you to cull as many mutts as possible. Bring me the lard as proof.
2120001011/I use the lard on the caskets, heheh. Here's your payment.
2120001012/Actually... I've a terrible debt with Thaler. Clear those debts, the cemetery key's yours.
2120001013/Particular! Come back when you know what you want.
2120001014/Yo ho ho and a bottle of... RUM!
2120001015/Learn anything?
2120001016/Hordes.
2120001017/Raymond? You wouldn't find a more loyal man.
2120001018/Think putting a dead body to rest is easy? Do what you will. Perhaps the watch captain will reward you.
2120001019/No. I promised to keep quiet.
2120001020/Don't know. You can have another body. They all reek the same.
2120001021/Examining remains is an art. Always worthwhile to look deeper... but who does that concern?
2120001022/Begone!
2120001023/You should plan ahead! Very well. What is it you want?
2120001024/Because the dead refuse to rest in peace.
2120001025/Fear not, they stay in their graves in sunlight. Someone should tend to them, though. Perhaps someone will offer a reward, but for now no one seems bothered.
2120001026/We'll all die.
2120001027/My lungs... some kind of curse... ugh..
2120001028/Come to daddy...
2120001029/Hit me, weakling.
2120001030/I've had enough!
2120001031/You fight like a wench.
2120001032/Shove off.
2120001033/I'm gonna kick your arse.
2120001034/Come on!
2120001035/I wanna hit someone.
2120001036/Who needs hitting?
2120001037/No challenge?
2120001038/You annoy me.
2120001039/I'll make you squeal.
2120001040/Oof.
2120001041/Kill them all!
2120001042/You'll regret the day you were born.
2120001043/Please no!
2120001044/By the gods, run!
2120001045/Stay away or I'll cut you like swine.
2120001046/Wouldn't mind a bite.
2120001047/Onward, move!
2120001048/Mess with me and die.
2120001049/Kill the bastard!
2120001050/Eh?
2120001051/What are you waiting for?
2120001052/Nothing doing.
2120001053/No further!
2120001054/I'll kill you!
2120001055/Any closer and you die.
2120001056/He's mine!
2120001057/Hmmm...
2120001058/Kill every last one!
2120001059/Meet death!
2120001060/Spare me!
2120001061/Retreat! You're on your own!
2120001062/Stay away or there'll be no mercy!
2120001063/This place stinks.
2120001064/Follow me, whoever stands!
2120001065/You lousy, stinking...
2120001066/He's yours, boys!
2120001067/I'll have your head!
2120001068/You stupid?
2120001069/Feel sorry for a whore?
2120001070/You there. Shove off.
2120001071/You've lost it, old man. Beat it before I cut you!
2120001072/Get lost, buddy.
2120001073/So you die!
2120001074/Draw you sword, drifter, I never kill defenceless people...
2120001075/Grab him!
2120001076/Shove off or I'll kill you like a dog.
2120001077/Shove off.
2120001078/At him!
2120001079/Leave while you can...
2120001080/This is our territory. Run.
2120001081/What turned your hair? Old wench nagging you?
2120001082/Lousy beer, lousy day.
2120001083/I despise this town.
2120001084/Spare a coin... my wife and kids lay ill...
2120001085/Witness the fight between Hamma and Loudmouth? Naught like it in years.
2120001086/I was born to royalty, but an evil hag transformed me.
2120001087/Shove off, mongrel!
2120001088/I've felt like beating someone since yesterday.
2120001089/Not so loud, I'm hung over.
2120001090/I need a good plowing.
2120001091/If you see Cobblelug, tell him we're looking for him.
2120001092/What?
2120001093/If you want to play dice, see Koster. Liquor from the waitress.
2120001094/Gambling hall. Enjoy yourself, drink and eat. No whores.
2120001095/Hit me, chickie.
2120001096/I'll smash yer face.
2120001097/I've had enough!
2120001098/You fight like a lass.
2120001099/Stand still!
2120001100/Fighting or watching?
2120001101/Your mother sucks dwarf cock.
2120001102/I'm itching to hit someone.
2120001103/No way, not me.
2120001104/Who can i fight?
2120001105/No challenge?
2120001106/Enough!
2120001107/Let the blood flow!
2120001108/Stay where you are!
2120001109/Kill! Kill!
2120001110/I'll send you to your grave!
2120001111/Watch it, jester.
2120001112/I'll kill you like a dog.
2120001113/No, I beg you!
2120001114/Run for your life!
2120001115/Stay where you are!
2120001116/Smash him.
2120001117/Keep close!
2120001118/I'll send you to your grave!
2120001119/Smash them.
2120001120/I'm sleepy.
2120001121/Die!
2120001122/That bastard called me a thief!
2120001123/Who does he think he is?
2120001124/Let me be!
2120001125/You must've made some mistake.
2120001126/So , interested in that job after all?
2120001127/Excellent. I'll mark the house on your map and wait here.
2120001128/Curiosity breeds complication, as me mum used to say, may the soil lie lightly upon her. Though I'm curious why you bear two swords on your back.
2120001129/I know of a house that contains a treasure, yet it is haunted and I'd rather not bother with ghosts. I'll tell you where it is, you get rid of the lost souls, and the treasure we shall split in half.
2120001130/Who're you? What d'you want?
2120001131/You a mercenary? Must make good coin. Interesting... I have a proposition for you.
2120001132/Get to work! Treasures await.
2120001133/I don't believe my eyes! Another fool seeking treasure.
2120001134/What?
2120001135/Hey boys! Found another goose to pluck, a fat one by his looks. Quickly! We'll tend to the elven lass later.
2120001136/Why you being so gentle with her, Butch?
2120001137/You'll be sorry!
2120001138/Hey, darling, what's in the basket?
2120001139/... plow her good, ha ha ha!
2120001140/Stay out of our way, gramps!
2120001141/Shut it, woman! I'll show you balls, heheh.
2120001142/Piss off, whitey, no monsters here.
2120001143/That I like - somebody who knows their place...
2120001144/Come on, then!
2120001145/I need booze and you look like a decent sort. How about a coin or two?
2120001146/Maggot?! I'll teach you manners, you mutt!
2120001147/Empty your pockets! I'll see for myself!
2120001148/I tend this road, make sure it stays smooth, which takes orens... Understand?
2120001149/What do I want?! You need to learn some manners! Hand over your coin or I'll break your legs, freak!
2120001150/Bastard! You asked for it!
2120001151/Well, look what the hellcat dragged in. Wait a second, traveler.
2120001152/Two?! Gimme a hundred and we're good!
2120001153/Don't understand human? Lemme spell it out for you!
2120001154/That'll do for today, but next time, it's two hundred or your arse will look like the Battle of Brenna!
2120001155/Move on.
2120001156/Aye, the bastards steal like magpies. No respect for private property.
2120001157/Best if he stayed away from them altogether.
2120001158/Thieving nonhumans!
2120001159/We're off to the village to wrangle some wenches. You coming?
2120001160/Bring your knife. They're less willing lately.
2120001161/All goes well?
2120001162/The devil leaves his own alone, heh heh.
2120001163/I wouldn't mind a swim.
2120001164/Who knows? None see a difference.
2120001165/She would've found it difficult to digest.
2120001166/Why did they take Princess Adda's pony away from her?
2120001167/What's the difference between monsters and tax collectors?
2120001168/Who knows, but just in case, let's lynch an elf.
2120001169/It's legal to hire a witcher to kill monsters.
2120001170/What crawls out of a hole, grunts and then cuts down a rabblebush?
2120001171/What's the difference between a sister in a religious order and the king's sister?
2120001172/Orders don't generally deflower their sisters.
2120001173/What happens when a sorceress polymorphs into a viper?
2120001174/Why couldn't I get a job as a royal official?
2120001175/I loathe taking bribes.
2120001176/Why did the druid slap the city guard?
2120001177/It was a natural reaction.
2120001178/Here to buy? Go see Brogg.
2120001179/This is Haren Brogg's territory, talk to him.
2120001180/Cursed nonhumans. Surprised the earth doesn't swallow them.
2120001181/I wouldn't harm a dog, but I'd crucify any elf.
2120001182/Help me! Help!
2120001183/I'm scared!
2120001184/Coo-coo!
2120001185/He he he!
2120001186/Boom tarara!
2120001187/That's poop. I don't want it.
2120001188/Stupid rain...!
2120001189/Everything's getting wet.
2120001190/Go ahead and rain.
2120001191/It's going to be so muddy.
2120001192/My tooth hurts.
2120001193/Where's your wife?
2120001194/Tag, hahaha!
2120001195/Stop it!
2120001196/I'll be a barman.
2120001197/Your threats don't impress me anymore. Prepare, sorcerer, I've come here for you!
2120001198/I was afraid I'd be late. Can you use a hand?
2120001199/I needed to think.
2120001200/Fucking witcher's fate.
2120001201/Die!
2120001202/Hey! Enough!
2120001203/Did you kill that thing or just find a corpse?
2120001204/Well, well, well... White Wolf himself.
2120001205/Looking for me, Wolf?
2120001206/What the hell am I doing here?
2120001207/You asked for it!
2120001208/Was that necessary?
2120001209/I don't like this.
2120001210/Nothing doing, White Wolf.
2120001211/"We'll meet again, White Wolf."
2120001212/Ladies and gentlemen! See the White Wolf tamed as he admits, in a tone colder than the north wind, that he thinks he's better!
2120001213/The noonwraith needs to awaken. Right now she's a mixture of the spirits of all the young women who died in the sun-drenched fields. Show her an object once dear to her. When I saw her, she did nothing but stare into a mirror. Pieces of that mirror lie scattered in the fields...
2120001214/There's more. The noonwraith needs to understand she's dead, though she'll only listen to the dead - so for instance you could kill yourself... But there's another way: some demons are sensitive to the arts. Try dancing, singing, reciting... as long as it's pretty and you do it with talent. That's it.
2120001215/Don't flatter yourself. I have only contempt for people like you.
2120001216/Willing to stain your snow-white armor of righteousness by talking to me?
2120001217/I betrayed Kaer Morhen's location to the Salamandra leader. Then I helped them with their research. I was hunting the Beast in the outskirts of Vizima when they captured me. I escaped and ran into Kalkstein, accepted his offer to open the tower in the swamp. That's when they nabbed me again. They weren't as nice the second time around... Finding Alvin, bringing him to them, was the only way I could save my skin.
2120001218/I wanted to tell you to your face, see that famous icy glare of yours.
2120001219/Does that mean you understand? You don't condemn me?
2120001220/Nice style, but not perfect. During a half-pirouette, you leave your groin unprotected...
2120001221/Meaning...
2120001222/What? Did they send you here to dissolve my contract? Fine by me. Take it!
2120001223/...that since we're both witchers, somehow we'd come to an agreement? To me, you're no better than that scoundrel the Professor. You're just a bigger hypocrite...
2120001224/I never said that.
2120001225/Ha ha! Straight to the point. Know why I'm laughing, Geralt?
2120001226/I'll demonstrate when we get out of here....
2120001227/Ha ha! Fine, play tough. As that old stooge Vesemir used to say, let's fight and see.
2120001228/I've been ready since childhood. Those bastards at Kaer Morhen saw to that...
2120001229/Well, it sounds like you need to talk to a diviner or the Lady of the Lake. Only they can tell you more.
2120001230/That was easy enough.
2120001231/Good luck. I suspect Raven was buried in it and I have long scoured cemeteries in hopes of finding it...
2120001232/Ha ha! That's right - the code forbids it.
2120001233/Fine, but not here. Let's go outside... Sit by my fire.
2120001234/The one negotiating a peace between humans and the vodyanoi. Both sides came to me. I have no intention of pursuing it and the job will fit your sainted legend perfectly.
2120001235/As a matter of fact I do. But first, I want to hear you admit you think highly of yourself.
2120001236/Yes?
2120001237/We can talk by the fire.
2120001238/You mean you're not looking for that legendary suit of armor? Well, you'll have to wait because a wraith and some bruxae will be here any minute. Think you can handle them?
2120001239/They called him Raven. He had connections to gnome inventors with superior technical knowledge. In their secret workshops beneath Mount Carbon, they created a suit of armor both durable and light... perfect for a witcher.
2120001240/All right, what's so urgent?
2120001241/So fight her without my help.
2120001242/Goddesses don't speak to mere mortals.
2120001243/Who said I wanted to talk? You gonna force me?
2120001244/The local blacksmith is an inventor, and knows the legend. You could also try the elven handyman.
2120001245/I'm laughing at you. So witcherly - fast, deadly and sure of yourself. With your unwavering sense of what's right. Think you're better than me?
2120001246/So, what momentous news did the local goddess divulge? Just... don't get all mystical on me...
2120001247/What do you want, witcher?
2120001248/I escaped as soon as I could. They got nothing out of me. I didn't sell anyone out. And then I came here.
2120001249/To do a half-spin correctly, you need to have both legs in working order. One of yours was crushed once...
2120001250/What the hell... It's a simple story. They found me some time ago and the Professor made me an offer I couldn't refuse. You know the kind - help us or we'll feed you your balls. I did what I had to do.
2120001251/Destiny doesn't interest me. But if you want to play hero, be my guest. I'll even help. See, I tricked you recently...
2120001252/You know why. I wanted to marry, have children, friends, a normal life... The witchers robbed me of that chance. This is nothing new to you...
2120001253/Humans hate me, when they see my eyes they blanch in fear. And children... Tell me, what's the difference between your dear Kaer Morhen and a Salamandra lab?
2120001254/Not a thing.
2120001255/How perceptive. There is one more thing. Salamandra wants Alvin. I don't know why, but he's important to them. They sent me here to find him, but I have no intention to. I just want to earn some orens and leave, for good...
2120001256/The famous White Wolf asks me for help?
2120001257/Yes. You leave your groin open when you do a half-spin. A beginner would notice. I even know why.
2120001258/It's funny. They remind me of witchers. Never had a choice - with them or you. The witchers made me a mutant, the Professor made me a criminal. On outcast twice over.
2120001259/Salamandra actually forced me to betray a few formulae, subjected me to some tests. I didn't even protest. They paid me well...
2120001260/So it goes. Live by the sword, die by the sword...
2120001261/Leave, the mere sight of you irks me. I'm beginning to doubt myself...
2120001262/Looks like we're done here.
2120001263/My take? Cull one of the two sides and the rest will fall into place.
2120001264/By the Lady of the Lake's altar on the shore. Sometimes the Dagon worshippers drive him away, so wait for him... if it's not beneath you.
2120001265/The legend, as legends do, tells of a great warrior. It's more boring than Dandelion's ballad about you, which is hardly possible... but it turns out our hero employed witchers' fighting techniques - while wearing armor. Was he a witcher? Who knows?
2120001266/You don't know the legend? I thought every little witcher had heard it.
2120001267/Draw your sword.
2120001268/I have a job I need to finish. Come with me if you like.
2120001269/Take this. We'll meet again, White Wolf.
2120001270/Run!
2120001271/I want your blood!
2120001272/Sweetie...
2120001273/Your blood is sweet.
2120001274/Stay away!
2120001275/Hmm?
2120001276/Follow me!
2120001277/Surrender!
2120001278/He's yours!
2120001279/They're yours!
2120001280/Ahhh.
2120001281/Lead the way.
2120001282/Murderers never know peace.
2120001283/How can you remain so confident as you stride into fate's jaws? I cannot bring myself to leave you here.
2120001284/As if I had a choice... You never knew feelings that controlled your every step.
2120001285/We're toys in the hands of fate. Before it casts us apart, accept my gift.
2120001286/Help me!
2120001287/Oh, I trust you'll come to my wedding!
2120001288/Are you here to see me?
2120001289/Help!
2120001290/We'll achieve nothing that way.
2120001291/I didn't mean to --
2120001292/Aaahhhhh...
2120001293/Ooooo! How I hate that nymphet. Now she's ensnared Julian, a wealthy town merchant, while she wanders about with her nose in the clouds.
2120001294/Better than Julian? Not woe-I-suffer-for-the-masses Adam? How pathetic! Or perhaps you mean the hermit? Such are my options. Did you see the engagement ring Julian gave Alina? A diamond larger than a pigeon's egg!
2120001295/Show me! It must be more beautiful than Alina's engagement ring.
2120001296/Ooo, how I despise her... She'll not have you! I'll give myself to you right now, on the nearest rock!
2120001297/I'm in no mood.
2120001298/... you merely need to give me a nicer ring than the one Julian gave Alina.
2120001299/She's happy. She has no concern for her younger sister. Alina doesn't deserve happiness.
2120001300/Yes?
2120001301/I have naught to wear to the wedding, for our father expended his savings on his beloved daughter's dowry...
2120001302/Furthermore, it's hot as hell... But all goes well otherwise.
2120001303/How untrue that revenge tastes better served cold.
2120001304/Good morning, witcher.
2120001305/N-no... I haven't.
2120001306/My sister will wed a man she doesn't like...
2120001307/Kiss me!
2120001308/That's the ring?! So be it. I'll show Alina I can have any man.
2120001309/Come back later.
2120001310/Why take her side? Admit it, she's dazzled you!!
2120001311/I fear the night. I always have... Woe is me...
2120001312/Will you help, witcher?
2120001313/Wanderer, driven on by the wind as I am... Why do you disturb me...?
2120001314/All I wanted was love... She had only disdain for him, scorning his feelings. I never would have done so...
2120001315/It was an accident! I had no wish to kill, but my anger bested me.
2120001316/What wrong did I in wishing to be with my beloved...? Surely, he would have grown to love me...
2120001317/Alina, it's me, Celina. As you can see, you have been avenged.
2120001318/I'm filled with regret. 'Tis justice. I am damned to wander the fields at night 'til the end of time...
2120001319/So one exists who is not indifferent to my fate. What is this? A wreath of immortelles... Crown me, white-haired one. Free me!
2120001320/Dear noble heart, I am damned for the ages.
2120001321/Nay, you hate me as all do. Woe is me!
2120001322/I, a monster? Then join the dance of death, monster slayer!
2120001323/Love denied, the sun denied. It buuuurrrnnnsss... At night I sing my plaintive song...
2120001324/Witcher, can you hear me? You, who are neither man nor ghost. Mortal whom death follows.
2120001325/I myself did in killing my sister, Alina! Out of jealousy...
2120001326/A soul damned to wander the world forever.
2120001327/Let's pray!
2120001328/From air, fire, war...
2120001329/Blessed are the humble.
2120001330/Protect me, Melitele!
2120001331/Oh, my back.
2120001332/That smells vile.
2120001333/Turbulent times.
2120001334/Yes?
2120001335/Can I help you?
2120001336/Don't!
2120001337/Wasting my time.
2120001338/What dreary weather!
2120001339/Will it stop raining?
2120001340/Wretched weather.
2120001341/It's raining so hard I can't see.
2120001342/Get that vileness off your belt!
2120001343/Protect me, Melitele!
2120001344/Oh, my back.
2120001345/What a stench.
2120001346/These are troubled times.
2120001347/Nasty, take it away!
2120001348/No, please don't!
2120001349/This weather...
2120001350/Can't rain any harder.
2120001351/Nasty weather.
2120001352/I can't see a thing.
2120001353/Guess what naughty, spoiled girls like best!
2120001354/Be my groom to keep me from gloom.
2120001355/Yes?
2120001356/Maybe next time.
2120001357/At least I'm not a seamstress.
2120001358/Unoriginal. You'll have to try harder.
2120001359/Let's go where we can be alone.
2120001360/A mere bauble. Only gemstones interest me.
2120001361/Naughty girls get the cleverest ideas.
2120001362/Good girls don't get promoted...
2120001363/Not so fast. Where's my gift?
2120001364/My dear departed husband thought me a she-devil. Care to tame me, whitey?
2120001365/Fold, glue, stamp... all day, all week...
2120001366/Bye.
2120001367/You look strange... How exciting.
2120001368/I fear opening the window to dump the chamber-pot after dusk.
2120001369/You stink like slime.
2120001370/How offensive.
2120001371/There's Scoia'tael downstairs.
2120001372/The Eternal Fire will protect us.
2120001373/We have to do something!
2120001374/I can't work like this...
2120001375/May I help you?
2120001376/Make yourself at home.
2120001377/Never heard his tragic fate? A death in the family... By Melitele, I won't speak of him behind his back.
2120001378/Welcome to my inn, traveler.
2120001379/Murky Waters. We live in seclusion. Tobias Hoffman leads us. Know, too, that our ancestors once inhabited the Underwater City.
2120001380/Ask, traveler.
2120001381/If you're weary, rest. If you wish food or drink, call my daughter.
2120001382/5 orens.
2120001383/Your kind isn't welcome. Begone!
2120001384/He lives in the village but prepares for a wedding, so likely has no time.
2120001385/They appeared long ago, before the City was engulfed. They live in underwater palaces.
2120001386/She's in the corral between the houses. Our pride and joy, she's made Murky Waters famous.
2120001387/An ancient underwater race. We used to respect each other, but relations have worsened.
2120001388/We glory in our ancient heritage, just as we take pride in our prize-winning cow. As for our ancestors' bad habits, much has changed since then.
2120001389/Some villain stole her. Perhaps a field devil or brownies - they're roguish beyond belief.
2120001390/You well know what I mean. The whole village whispers of your battles with the beasts from the deep.
2120001391/You proved yourself a hero and deserve special treatment, but perhaps another time.
2120001392/Lake waters engulfed the Underwater City. Some say the gods were angered by debauchery. Now the vodyanoi inhabit the city.
2120001393/No. Brownies grow larger, cleverer, and spiteful. We stopped leaving bowls of milk on our doorsteps and they disappeared. Perhaps the little ruffians repaid us by rustling our cow?
2120001394/They produce tools and baubles, including the famous stones of Ys, supposedly magical.
2120001395/If he's occupied, try speaking with his future son-in-law, Julian.
2120001396/Their warriors, though fierce in battle, seldom attack on land. They chiefly drive away treasure hunters.
2120001397/I should sweep up.
2120001398/What a mess!
2120001399/May all customers leave satisfied.
2120001400/They tracked mud in again.
2120001401/A fine day.
2120001402/5 orens, just for you.
2120001403/Just a moment...
2120001404/How can I help?
2120001405/I'll be back in a minute.
2120001406/I'm feeling under the weather.
2120001407/Aaaaaa!!!
2120001408/What a day...
2120001409/Argh.
2120001410/No, please don't!
2120001411/Wasting your time.
2120001412/The weather's gone sour.
2120001413/Oh, it's raining.
2120001414/I won't have to water my garden.
2120001415/Storm's come in.
2120001416/Crime rises and the city guards just stare at skirts!
2120001417/How rude!
2120001418/NOT_USED
2120001419/NOT_USED
2120001420/NOT_USED
2120001421/They've thrown the nonhumans out, and the disease with them.
2120001422/Obviously, the threat of epidemic is gone.
2120001423/I wonder what he prays for.
2120001424/Me too?
2120001425/I blame monsters.
2120001426/They went to work for bread and encountered death.
2120001427/Someone must stop all the drunkenness.
2120001428/A man should earn his family's keep.
2120001429/I've not once looked at him!
2120001430/Kiss my arse!
2120001431/What, war?
2120001432/Simply to frighten Redania. Fret not.
2120001433/Already I breathe easier.
2120001434/But they hold something against you. Haven't you heard of the Scoia'taels' brutal attacks?
2120001435/Doubtless.
2120001436/Why? He should know we're watching him.
2120001437/Truly?
2120001438/When the Order finishes the nonhumans, our troubles will be over.
2120001439/Did they stay together forever?
2120001440/What?
2120001441/How sweet.
2120001442/Why?
2120001443/Foolish wench.
2120001444/A filthy rich merchant from Nilfgaard.
2120001445/Gold opens all doors.
2120001446/Who's Merigold, a dog?
2120001447/Foltest quarreled viciously with the council.
2120001448/I've waited weeks for the counselors to consider my case.
2120001449/Why such white hair, good man?
2120001450/I rarely do this.
2120001451/So tired. My neighbor disturbed my sleep, beating his wife again.
2120001452/I learned an old folk remedy from my mother. I'll need nine handfuls of glimmering dust from the hair of noonwraiths in the fields.
2120001453/Come back later.
2120001454/I have this herb manual listing local herbs. Bring me dust to scare off the succubus and you'll have the book.
2120001455/There you are, bless you.
2120001456/You're quite thin. I made ribs in mead yesterday. Care for some?
2120001457/Oh, it's nothing. My husband slaughtered a pig, and I decided to make sauerkraut stew. I have other specialties...
2120001458/Deal.
2120001459/Finally! I'll make my husband an amulet to repel the succubus. The herb manual, as agreed.
2120001460/I'll doubtless need you sometime.
2120001461/Bring me nine handfuls of glimmering dust from the noonwraiths in the field. These phantoms only come out in daytime.
2120001462/If memory serves, a witcher is like a magical warrior?
2120001463/I'm cooking a traditional Temerian sauerkraut stew.
2120001464/That old fool found himself a succubus! Thinks I can't hear them frolicking at night.
2120001465/Yes! I'm having terrible trouble with my husband.
2120001466/Master witcher...
2120001467/Greetings, what brings you here?
2120001468/5 orens.
2120001469/Hold on...
2120001470/How can I help?
2120001471/Wait here.
2120001472/Mama and Papa own the inn. Mama won't let me speak to strangers.
2120001473/Not true. Only regulars visit our inn. Got you there!
2120001474/You're Geralt of Rivia. Master Dandelion sang a ballad about you, so I know you.
2120001475/She gives 10 quarts of milk daily.
2120001476/A true queen.
2120001477/If your money pouch is bursting, try the New Narakort. You might also choose the Hairy Bear... if you have the nerve.
2120001478/You don't look like one to be lucky at love, but I wager your luck excels at dice.
2120001479/Sir, I wouldn't cheat you. An honest game's what I propose.
2120001480/The peasants 'round here have nothing but cabbage to wager. A hunter, a worthy opponent, used to fancy a game, but I haven't seen him in a while.
2120001481/To be frank, he loved high stakes, yet the dice disliked him from the outset.
2120001482/Risk is your daily bread - that's clear. I'd consider it an honor to play you.
2120001483/Must've been quite a lover, for I've never seen such ill luck on a man. He lost a lot of orens...
2120001484/That depends entirely on who one plays, sir. The wagers are certainly larger in Vizima.
2120001485/I think not, sir. You could smell the loser in him a mile off. The debts must be keeping him away.
2120001486/I respect risk-takers.
2120001487/Leave me be!
2120001488/They're killing us!
2120001489/No! No!
2120001490/None care to try their strength?
2120001491/No bold men?
2120001492/No daredevils here today.
2120001493/I don't want that.
2120001494/Care to play dice?
2120001495/Play me, try your luck.
2120001496/Brought a partner?
2120001497/They're killing us!
2120001498/No! No!
2120001499/Lean year ahead of us.
2120001500/Maybe I should move.
2120001501/I'm tired.
2120001502/Geeeoooh. What was that supposed to mean?
2120001503/It's raining, too.
2120001504/Damnable rain!
2120001505/Cursed downpour!
2120001506/I detest rain!
2120001507/Another round?
2120001508/Welcome, traveler.
2120001509/What you want?
2120001510/Always help my friends.
2120001511/I work for Leuvaarden, a wealthy merchant. He has maaany jobs.
2120001512/Aahh... I've had enough.
2120001513/What if I do?
2120001514/Tenner apiece...
2120001515/Sure.
2120001516/Shove off!
2120001517/I'm watching the entrance in case of a raid.
2120001518/Sooner or later, one frustrated gambler will betray us to the army.
2120001519/Anyone follow you here?
2120001520/Begone.
2120001521/We may be raided at any moment.
2120001522/Nothing for you.
2120001523/Exotic goods from Zerrikania, fragrant with roots!
2120001524/Do royals sell Royal Strong Ale?
2120001525/I will not play dice!
2120001526/I'm broke. Another day perhaps.
2120001527/Tried that. That's why I'm broke.
2120001528/You, sir! Step here.
2120001529/No pain, no gain.
2120001530/Three elements remain of Raven's armor: a spaulder, a rerebrace and a gauntlet. The highest quality iron ores and state of the art technologies were used in its making. Not some useless Temerian smelting pots.
2120001531/Take this pouch. What a man won't sacrifice for... No matter.
2120001532/Bring me nine handfuls of shadow dust. To do that, go to the fields and kill several devourers, from which you can scrape the dust.
2120001533/I know nothing about the legend. I'm more interested in technology. That armor was a breakthrough in armor design, made possible by advances in metallurgy and smelting...
2120001534/As I said, only parts of the armor remain. To recreate the entire suit, you must find replacement material and someone to assemble the parts.
2120001535/A folk spell will put the succubus to sleep for a while. My wife will calm down and afterwards, I can quietly awake the succubus...
2120001536/I can tell you about its qualities...
2120001537/That I understand! Here.
2120001538/Not a word to my wife!
2120001539/Red meteorite is a rare metal used to strengthen blades. And gold... well, figure it out.
2120001540/Thanks! Which reward will you claim?
2120001541/The gnomes surpass us technologically by an age. Beneath Mount Carbon, they have blast furnaces and quenching tanks, equipment beyond our reach.
2120001542/Search crypts where great knights were interred. I heard the counts of the Ruyter dynasty wore similar armor. Pieces of that should be reforgeable.
2120001543/My wife exaggerates about the frolicking. As a man, you understand innocent entertainment harms no one...
2120001544/Nine handfuls of shadow dust from devourers. They appear in the fields at night and are very dangerous.
2120001545/I overheard you speaking with my wife. I have an offer for you...
2120001546/Master handyman at your service. I handle repairs of all kinds, produce strange and nonstandard objects, and am a capable, creative blacksmith and carpenter...
2120001547/How can I help the gentleman?
2120001548/Yes?
2120001549/Greetings...
2120001550/I have red meteorite, which can improve your sword. Or perhaps you'd prefer gold, say 500 orens?
2120001551/Like new. Now, 100 orens?
2120001552/My kin and I yearn to build a flying machine. We built several already, but none worked. We had to cover the pilot's medical expenses...
2120001553/For 100 orens.
2120001554/One has to survive, so I offer other services. Besides, I have an expensive hobby.
2120001555/As you wish. The technologies I mention allow for the production of steel both hard and flexible. Essentially indestructible.
2120001556/Well, he acts like an animal in bed...
2120001557/Did I make you blush?
2120001558/Thank you, Geralt! Thanks again!
2120001559/...I rather like it...
2120001560/I hope your snake rots, murderer!
2120001561/Piss off, bastard.
2120001562/They still speak of you... Shani and I have become friends.
2120001563/She treats the sick and wounded no matter their race. Not all look kindly on that.
2120001564/I will, witcher, thank you.
2120001565/What do you want, witcher?
2120001566/You can't afford it.
2120001567/Unfortunately, I haven't seen her... since it all began.
2120001568/Murderer! You killed my beloved Vincent!
2120001569/So naive... I thought I could expect more from you than mindless slaughter! Heard so much about you...
2120001570/... threw me out of the house. What was I to do? I became a Viziman whore, and then lost the only person I ever loved.
2120001571/I may forgive you someday, witcher. Not today.
2120001572/Out of my sight!
2120001573/I'm all lone now...
2120001574/Of course! My belly grew and then my loving daddy, the plowing priest of the Eternal Fire...
2120001575/Don't interrupt! An uphill battle, all my life. Vilified, reviled. First that rogue Mikul and his group...
2120001576/Argh.
2120001577/Someone help!
2120001578/Help!
2120001579/What's that vileness on your belt?
2120001580/Why hurry?
2120001581/Oh my.
2120001582/Hmm.
2120001583/Grant me a moment?
2120001584/I won't accept it.
2120001585/A real downpour.
2120001586/Terrible weather.
2120001587/Aa.
2120001588/Someone help me!
2120001589/Help!
2120001590/Where'd you get that nasty thing?
2120001591/What's the rush, warrior?
2120001592/Oh my.
2120001593/Hm.
2120001594/Whitey, give me a moment?
2120001595/I don't want that.
2120001596/A real downpour.
2120001597/Grim weather.
2120001598/Vincent complained about you...
2120001599/All right, I'll be there.
2120001600/Nice to see you.
2120001601/Depends. I'm open to suggestions.
2120001602/You mad? Some local boys take care of us... They just couldn't handle those freaks.
2120001603/We whores know how to show gratitude.
2120001604/A charmer... If this conversation carries on I'll want some of that fruit.
2120001605/As you wish... 200 orens.
2120001606/I'm not the Sisters of Mercy Society.
2120001607/Not yet. Keep trying.
2120001608/Some clients like to play dice at the same time. Interested?
2120001609/All right, we'll chat... but I'm counting on more.
2120001610/We know so little about love. It's like a pear, sweet and shapely, but try describing that shape without saying 'pear.'
2120001611/Not so fast... We just met.
2120001612/Thanks for helping. They leave us alone now.
2120001613/The Good Book says no service goes unrewarded. I'll make it known around town and amongst the working girls.
2120001614/There're three places they frequent at night...
2120001615/The girls will be impressed. They're sure to give you a discount.
2120001616/What's it to be? 200 orens... unless you'd rather collect another way?
2120001617/Plenty. But I'm the prettiest.
2120001618/Some men are troubling my girls. Take care of it and we'll compensate you... generously.
2120001619/Anything for you... and I'll give you a good price - say a hundred orens?
2120001620/You're quite unique, but there's no shortage of frauds who'd pretend they're you. Let's agree you'll bring the girls flowers if there's any doubt.
2120001621/For certain! I've never heard of a patron who gave flowers to a whore.
2120001622/We are grateful. Whores have their honor, you know.
2120001623/Care to relax a little, handsome?
2120001624/Witcher, it's none of my business but...
2120001625/He's been trying to get those Salamanders. You rile him, but he's a good man... he'll calm down when the case is solved.
2120001626/I'm an escort. Respected throughout Vizima. I once frequented the royal court, too.
2120001627/Business, sweetie, strictly business.
2120001628/It's fine, no need to beat around the bush...
2120001629/Cheers.
2120001630/Cheers.
2120001631/Hope you're not mad.
2120001632/I have an idea: let's play a game.
2120001633/Get going, your dare awaits!
2120001634/Ha! How kind.
2120001635/Your choice.
2120001636/Still water runs deep...
2120001637/Geralt, care to tell us more about this... situation?
2120001638/Sweetie, you clearly don't know Dandelion that well. They don't call him "the tongue of the North" for no reason.
2120001639/Relax, Dandelion, no. Let's say... you'd have to steal something from the old lady's cupboard downstairs.
2120001640/Truth or dare.
2120001641/Be sure to fetch something interesting, honey.
2120001642/Quiet, I'm listening!
2120001643/To Hela!
2120001644/This is fascinating...
2120001645/I don't know much about vampires but I do know a trick called "The Vampire's Kiss..."
2120001646/Oh, the usual, why don't you come by?
2120001647/Please don't hurt him!
2120001648/Our business has taken a dive. That one gets more customers than all my girls together...
2120001649/I'll give this potion to Vincent.
2120001650/How will I repay you?
2120001651/Greetings. You've returned safely.
2120001652/Hela, but that's too common.
2120001653/Don't know about vampires, but there's a new blue-eyed whore at the Trade Quarter cathouse.
2120001654/I have no desire to look at you!
2120001655/Only my man is important now.
2120001656/I'll not betray my man's identity. I'd rather he stay a werewolf.
2120001657/Yes... Lemme get you the address. I suppose she won't be there much longer now you've taken an interest.
2120001658/Oh!
2120001659/That's what I'll do!
2120001660/I'll be waiting.
2120001661/Thank you! I'll start immediately.
2120001662/It was terrifying. The moon appeared, Vincent transformed, shredded the shirt and ran off.
2120001663/But we make love regularly!
2120001664/I know Vincent doesn't love me. Sometimes, when he's angry, he calls me a vile whore...
2120001665/I know I turn tricks. But for him, I'd agreed to be like other girls. Dammit, I'd even learn how to embroider...
2120001666/He's unsure... torn between me and his work.
2120001667/Witcher, please talk to him, he's at the station.
2120001668/Oh, witcher, I don't know how to thank you! I'm awash in happiness! We had an honest conversation, I told him everything, how much I love him.
2120001669/He said if I cared so much, maybe this love deserves a chance. First time I ever saw him cry!
2120001670/But that's not all! I haven't found hair in our bed recently! Maybe... never mind, I don't want to jinx it... I have to believe that everything will be all right.
2120001671/Oh, master witcher! I made certain Vincent drank it, but nothing happened.
2120001672/Yes?
2120001673/Fat Sophie told me the druids may have a potion I could buy.
2120001674/He's a werewolf and I don't want him killed...
2120001675/My man... He's sick - I have to help him before it's too late.
2120001676/I've handled worse in the slums. And I carry a knife...
2120001677/Thank you. I'll wait at home, the building opposite the tavern in the slums.
2120001678/I... can't bring myself to say it.
2120001679/Witcher...
2120001680/Witcher! I'm Carmen. Remember me from Vizima?
2120001681/I... I had to come here...
2120001682/Why this intrusion, knight?
2120001683/There is no spell! Your sister is here of her own volition. She was unwilling to spend her life washing dishes and spreading her legs for a rotting old man!
2120001684/You promised us respite, you lay with my daughters... and now we're of no concern? You two-faced scoundrel.
2120001685/Geralt of Rivia was different. He would never go back on his word.
2120001686/Be patient. In time, you will.
2120001687/Come, dear daughters. Time to show the witcher the source of all legends about the House of the Night.
2120001688/Someone will die. You, me, the blue-eyed girl. Would it be right to choose death, even the death of a vampire?
2120001689/She summoned me herself. In her dreams, fantasies. She yearned for freedom... and eternal beauty.
2120001690/You wished to ask me something?
2120001691/Forget you're a witcher and call yourself a friend.
2120001692/I fulfill their dreams - if only for a brief moment. And dreams are priceless.
2120001693/I'm the Queen of the Night. I realize my clients' dreams, leaving them relaxed and content...
2120001694/I know, witcher. I've followed your deeds for some time.
2120001695/And you believe that? Don't be naive. The girl lives like a princess here. She wears the finest silks. Clients sell their estates to spend a single night with her. She enjoys servants and comforts you couldn't dream of.
2120001696/I can name quite a few ordinary animals that leave marks such as those.
2120001697/My daughters and I drink our customers' blood. We never kill. Their blood pays for our services. Everyone profits.
2120001698/Yet I never kill. Blood energizes me, like alcohol does humans. In any case, I've never hurt a soul.
2120001699/I sensed that when I drank her blood. What are you looking at? Yes, I'm the vampire who haunts this house.
2120001700/Don't concern yourself with that. I appreciate that at his death he had friends. True friends.
2120001701/My lover, whom I've never forgotten, called you friend. He perished helping you battle a powerful foe. But that was long ago. What brings you here?
2120001702/Her brother wished to give her in marriage to some old fool with hemorrhoids larger than a.... No matter. She, on the other hand, desires to be a princess of the night. An eternally beautiful forbidden fruit. Vizima's dream.
2120001703/His habit nearly killed him. Angry peasants attacked him. After he recovered, he led a loner's life, until he met you.
2120001704/Well, is that polite? Barging in without an invitation?
2120001705/Then refusing to answer questions... The Geralt of Rivia I heard of was a courteous witcher.
2120001706/The lesser evil, Geralt. You must choose it at times to avoid the greater evil that lurks in the darkness.
2120001707/Now? Business will return to normal. We simply need to clear the corpses.
2120001708/I regret this had to end so. These men doubtless promised you gold... I could grant you a share of my profits.
2120001709/How should I know? I cast none. Spells can often be hard to distinguish from fascinations.
2120001710/She'll do as she pleases. We'll let her rest for a time.
2120001711/I never said he was a man. More importantly, you were a friend to him. Alas, Regis just drank too much. Thus we parted.
2120001712/Pray that you're as able as legend claims.
2120001713/We're not monsters, Geralt. I'll offer you a deal... one night with my daughters in exchange for peace, for forgetting this entire matter.
2120001714/Help!
2120001715/I work too much...
2120001716/Hm, handsome...
2120001717/I'm dying of boredom.
2120001718/Spare me! Please!
2120001719/Oh, my dress is wet.
2120001720/My hair!
2120001721/I definitely prefer sunshine.
2120001722/I'm sleepy.
2120001723/Ha! You jest!
2120001724/Care to spend time with a lady?
2120001725/Hey, handsome!
2120001726/Flee!
2120001727/Sweetie...
2120001728/The cat shows its claws.
2120001729/Noooo!
2120001730/Stay away!
2120001731/Hmm?
2120001732/Follow me!
2120001733/Surrender!
2120001734/Come to me!
2120001735/He's yours!
2120001736/They're yours!
2120001737/Ahhh.
2120001738/Heeeelp!
2120001739/How much longer?...
2120001740/I work too much.
2120001741/I need some time off.
2120001742/Please don't!
2120001743/Are you a fool?
2120001744/Such weather.
2120001745/Oh my, more rain.
2120001746/At least I won't need to water my garden.
2120001747/Storm's come in.
2120001748/NOT_USED
2120001749/Never let the witcher guess what you hide from him.
2120001750/I assume you've resolved matters with Leuvaarden as well?
2120001751/Don't overdo it. Geralt can be exceptionally perceptive...
2120001752/And how is your witcher?
2120001753/Noble sir.
2120001754/You don't look familiar... Whatever, 300 orens.
2120001755/I'm disappointed.
2120001756/Lovely gift. You impress me.
2120001757/No, sir. I await a proposition from you.
2120001758/Come, pleasures await.
2120001759/I thought no man could teach me more... I was mistaken.
2120001760/Plenty of customers today...
2120001761/We only serve the higher class people, sweetheart.
2120001762/You don't look like one who can afford the entertainment here...
2120001763/Stop! You don't stand a chance against us!
2120001764/*Hiss* rrrraaauuuu...
2120001765/But... I was never under any spell...
2120001766/Yes...
2120001767/Greetings, sir.
2120001768/You know what you are? A hired assassin, killing for a handful of gold! And Madame spoke well of you.
2120001769/You killed her...
2120001770/Shove off, bum.
2120001771/With pleasure, white-haired one. But you must first make a contribution to the House of the Night. A mere 500 orens.
2120001772/Leave me be, murderer!
2120001773/Entirely. This is my home. My Sisters of the Night.
2120001774/We can always bargain. How does 750 sound?
2120001775/How interesting. What would you say to 1000?
2120001776/Ah... I would like the night to last forever...
2120001777/I'm no ordinary girl. I can prove it. Simply ask...
2120001778/Like it?
2120001779/If you like, I'll show you more...
2120001780/That's nonsense! You've destroyed our lives, mine and all those here. Now we'll have to work the streets like cheap whores.
2120001781/Know what, witcher? I have a task for you. Kill my brother. How much do you want?
2120001782/Patience. First a hot bath, then your dreams will come true...
2120001783/What would you have, my white-haired lord?
2120001784/Come back with coin.
2120001785/Nice bauble... but I've always enjoyed sapphires... my eye color.
2120001786/Thank you. Follow me.
2120001787/I hope your cock turns blue and rots off, murderer! Begone!
2120001788/What? No! I have no family.
2120001789/You son of bitch! Who gave you the right to ruin the lives of others? To decide their fate?
2120001790/All right, let's speak. Giacomo Cassano claims nothing surpasses cultured conversation as foreplay...
2120001791/Regular customer? Three hundred orens with the discount.
2120001792/Leave me be, murderer!
2120001793/You're the one who doesn't fucking understand! You marched into my life, boots and all, and destroyed it! You killed those I held dear, out of greed for my idiot brother's gold... OUT!
2120001794/Shut your trap. Take what you will and get out my life, butcher.
2120001795/Twas my first time witnessing a witcher's sword in action. I've no desire to see more.
2120001796/Finally he got his just desserts. That fool nearly ruined my life.
2120001797/None. You have no idea what horrors I experienced before escaping him.
2120001798/Haven't you had your fill of killing? Begone!
2120001799/Something ends, something else begins...
2120001800/Thank you, witcher. Thank you for... your humanity.
2120001801/I feel weak. I need to rest.
2120001802/Talk to the Lady of the Night.
2120001803/My, that's a large sword.
2120001804/Mummy, can we play with him?
2120001805/So are interesting men. If you don't care to play, leave.
2120001806/Unlucky in love? Perhaps you're lucky at dice.
2120001807/Fancy a try at dice?
2120001808/I love gambling.
2120001809/Yes?
2120001810/Leave me!
2120001811/You're not my type.
2120001812/Only gambling holds my interest.
2120001813/I play dice for coin, but I also play Signs.
2120001814/His name was Geralt of Rivia.
2120001815/He was a witcher, a professional monster-slayer.
2120001816/An unusual contract: to lift the curse that held a monarch's daughter.
2120001817/It was enough to spend the night with the princess. Dusk till dawn.
2120001818/If only she were not a deadly beast, a striga...
2120001819/The traitor responsible for the curse became the bait.
2120001820/Though gravely wounded, the witcher lifted the curse and gained fame.
2120001821/The world changed with the coming of the Great War, the Time of the Sword and Axe, the Time of Disdain.
2120001822/Geralt of Rivia disappeared, all but forgotten... But that’s another story.
2120001823/I seek the grave of Raven, the great warrior. They say it contains vast treasures.
2120001824/Horrid monsters attacked, then stones fell, trapping me. Were it not for you, sir...
2120001825/The Eternal Fire must have sent you, master!
2120001826/To enter the corridors leading left and right, remove the rocks. Good luck...
2120001827/Mercy!
2120001828/You're a witcher! Protect us from the Order's beasts!
2120001829/The Grand Master's released beasts into the city! Madness!
2120001830/You resemble one of those beasts the Grand Master created.
2120001831/My brother entrusted his safety to the Grand Master. Why didn't I stay with him at the monastery?
2120001832/Did Foltest send you? I knew the king would care for his subjects.
2120001833/What do you call those armored beasts that attacked us, witcher?
2120001834/I left all behind for the looters.
2120001835/I won't talk to you.
2120001836/Who created such monsters?
2120001837/They resembled humans yet seemed inhuman. They were armed and spoke, but they chased me like emotionless hunting dogs, trained to kill.
2120001838/Only fire and death beyond this point.
2120001839/Stop, bastard!
2120001840/Can I earn coin here?
2120001841/Ah, if I were a wealthy man...
2120001842/Excellent.
2120001843/Help!
2120001844/What's with you?!
2120001845/I'll be soaked.
2120001846/Quite a driving rain.
2120001847/My feet are wet.
2120001848/Deluge coming.
2120001849/I wager I can improve your weapon.
2120001850/I can improve your weapon.
2120001851/Desist, you bastard!
2120001852/How could I make coin here?
2120001853/Ah, if I were a rich man.
2120001854/Oh!
2120001855/People, help!
2120001856/Oh, we're getting angry.
2120001857/It's raining.
2120001858/I'm gonna be all wet.
2120001859/What a downpour.
2120001860/We're in for a deluge.
2120001861/Enough!
2120001862/If I were you, I'd avoid the streets at night.
2120001863/Don't venture into the nonhumans' district. Those disgusting midgets'll rob you!
2120001864/Begone!
2120001865/The fatherland needs him, or some nonsense.
2120001866/Curses! My son's enlisted in the army.
2120001867/True, saw nothing beyond books.
2120001868/Let's meet at the New Narakort tonight.
2120001869/Drink with me?
2120001870/Jesting?
2120001871/When will you repay me?
2120001872/I'll never see my gold.
2120001873/Greetings.
2120001874/Still angry?
2120001875/They say the Lionhead Spider cult returned to town.
2120001876/The Order protects us now.
2120001877/Later. I'm sleeping.
2120001878/Someone who understands! Can I help?
2120001879/Before I evaluate the sword, you must fetch me a gemstone.
2120001880/Fetch me metal ores, or runic stones to embed in the blade.
2120001881/I dislike taxes and guild payments; thus I prefer goods in exchange for my services.
2120001882/Greetings. My specialities involve more than common blacksmithery.
2120001883/I'll see what I can do...
2120001884/How may I help?
2120001885/A precious stone suitable for the hilt of a weapon for Count de Wett.
2120001886/Why these barricades?
2120001887/I had a dream! The river ghosts begged me for assistance. Me, a humble servant of the Lady of the Lake! A lifetime's chance to show my devotion!
2120001888/About a month, if the griggs kept away.
2120001889/Not only repairs - I'll make it wider! The river ghosts will have the finest bridge in Temeria!
2120001890/Tell no one where you got it. The hermit will get irate if he learns I... borrowed it.
2120001891/He's brave, though not clever. He'll stay with you while you cross the fields.
2120001892/Greetings, you'll not get any further. The bridge is destroyed.
2120001893/Visit the old wench in the village. Beware! She's a witch, but she may know some means of driving off griggs.
2120001894/400 orens as promised.
2120001895/Even if I could ward off the night demons, it would be pointless. Griggs don't speak with humans.
2120001896/I witnessed griggs gallavanting about the divine statue by the bridge. They see the bridge as their territory.
2120001897/The old bridge I tended fell into ruin. Yet the ghosts remain attached to it. They asked me to restore it to order.
2120001898/A book about specters and the King of the Hunt, 400 orens or my son to fight alongside you whenever you cross the fields.
2120001899/We'll speak tomorrow, okay?
2120001900/My life's work stands at the edge of oblivion! You alone can help...
2120001901/Do you wish 400 orens or a book about specters and the King of the Wild Hunt? Or you can have my son's help during dangerous excursions. He's an excellent archer.
2120001902/What my son and I erect in daytime is destroyed each night! I'll wager it's damnable griggs!
2120001903/I'm impressed.
2120001904/Perhaps I can finish the bridge before the first snowfall... Your reward.
2120001905/Come back later.
2120001906/In a small hut by the tavern. She'll tell you how to drive off griggs. I'd go myself, buy she has the evil eye...
2120001907/Sir?
2120001908/You're a witcher?
2120001909/There's just forests and meadows over there.
2120001910/I work hard, but the wife and kids ever plague me.
2120001911/Protect us from the Beast.
2120001912/I'm selling nothing.
2120001913/The famous witcher!
2120001914/I don't fear you.
2120001915/Now I loiter around cesspools. Because of one fight...
2120001916/No weapons, no armor...
2120001917/I was once invincible... the Great White Hope.
2120001918/Leave me. Enough humiliation.
2120001919/Here.
2120001920/300. Take it and begone.
2120001921/Did you train with the Lion?
2120001922/Take your prize.
2120001923/Return tomorrow to lose another 200 orens.
2120001924/200 orens.
2120001925/Andrew Gablodda!
2120001926/One punch, deadly... and I realized I'd never win. I've worn a hood ever since to avoid being recognized.
2120001927/A boxer! I had fans galore. Women, gold! And now...!
2120001928/Judges disliked blows below the belt. They disqualified me.
2120001929/Not now.
2120001930/... I fought the Lion.
2120001931/You anger me.
2120001932/I fought until...
2120001933/It was a spiritual transformation. But I can take you!
2120001934/Take it and begone.
2120001935/I feel horny.
2120001936/Kill them!
2120001937/I'll kill you!
2120001938/Noooo!
2120001939/Run!
2120001940/Come no closer.
2120001941/Follow me!
2120001942/I want him dead.
2120001943/I'll piss on your corpse.
2120001944/Yoo-hoo!
2120001945/Bastard!
2120001946/Oh, a jester.
2120001947/Interested?
2120001948/An unforgettable high!
2120001949/Eat dirt.
2120001950/I'm horny.
2120001951/Outta here!
2120001952/Stay away.
2120001953/Everybody follow me!
2120001954/I'll piss on your corpse.
2120001955/Kill him.
2120001956/Get to it!
2120001957/Yoo-hoo.
2120001958/You bastard!
2120001959/Oh, a jester.
2120001960/Flee!
2120001961/You'll be eating dirt.
2120001962/Those guards piss me off.
2120001963/Die!
2120001964/Noooo!
2120001965/Stay away.
2120001966/Everybody follow me!
2120001967/I want him dead.
2120001968/Get on them!
2120001969/Damn hole.
2120001970/You bastard!
2120001971/What?
2120001972/You annoy me.
2120001973/What do you want?
2120001974/Retreat, I said!
2120001975/I've waited long for this moment.
2120001976/Uh.
2120001977/I'm innocent! Spare me!
2120001978/Come here. I feel like hitting someone.
2120001979/Follow me! Move your fat arses!
2120001980/I want to see corpses.
2120001981/I'll kill you with pleasure.
2120001982/I want to see corpses everywhere!
2120001983/Fuckin' hell!
2120001984/Now you die.
2120001985/Huh?
2120001986/Mind your own business.
2120001987/Piss off, informer.
2120001988/Greetings, look who's here.
2120001989/Sold it to Thaler for twice the gold... Brickmakers nearly gave it away...
2120001990/You buying?
2120001991/Swamps recently. What do you care?
2120001992/Shove off!
2120001993/I was sitting with me friends, and we's drinking all by then, but she didn't see me cry, 'cause I hit her in the eye and now she's...
2120001994/Aye, when I met those peasants in the swamp. Bought that witcher's gear from them, real cheap...
2120001995/I sell things, travel about.
2120001996/You had it...?
2120001997/I'm busy.
2120001998/They call me Coleman.
2120001999/Oooh, my head's spinning... Heheheh... What? A witcher...? You scheming with Salamandra, too?
2120002000/Curses! Always happens to me. Maybe we can bribe someone...
2120002001/Just don't offer to deliver my packages again, get it?
2120002002/100 orens.
2120002003/I should think so.
2120002004/You're dead meat!
2120002005/What a fool! I thought my boys would get some exercise. Still... a hundred's always welcome.
2120002006/Heard you broke them before they could blink. Should've said you were a witcher.
2120002007/Come on, no hard feelings. We're pals, right?
2120002008/Well, since you mention it...
2120002009/There's an haunted house... more suited to an exorcist than a witcher.
2120002010/I want results. Chairs should stand still, doors remain closed, and pots hang on the wall peacefully. Willing to check it out?
2120002011/Great. The house is by the sewer entrance, near the gate to the dike.
2120002012/Leave me be!
2120002013/Where've you been? White powder - fisstech.
2120002014/I sell my friends other goods, but you're no friend.
2120002015/Quiet, witcher, I can't.
2120002016/And if that's all I saw...?
2120002017/Wait! Someone's coming!
2120002018/Careful! He's a witcher, he's dangerous!
2120002019/Witcher?
2120002020/Witcher?
2120002021/Stop playing the fool... You know.
2120002022/Here's 100 orens... don't turn me in.
2120002023/I'm... helping Vincent dismantle the secret Salamandra organization.
2120002024/Oh... Some fool keeps killing Salamanders, spoiling our traps and schemes.
2120002025/No, but if I find him, I'll stop his meddling.
2120002026/You had it...?
2120002027/Curses! Always happens to me. Maybe we can bribe someone...
2120002028/Just don't deliver my packages again, get it?
2120002029/100 orens.
2120002030/I should think so.
2120002031/You're dead meat!
2120002032/What a fool! I thought my boys would get some exercise. Still... a hundred's always welcome.
2120002033/Heard you broke them before they could blink. Should've said you were a witcher.
2120002034/Come on, no hard feelings. We're pals, right?
2120002035/In small doses, it lifts your spirits. Larger ones cause euphoria, maybe aggression, but relieve pain and fatigue. Looking for fun or entering the business?
2120002036/Shove off!
2120002037/Richboy? Feel like sharing?
2120002038/Looking for adventure?
2120002039/Someone stole my trousers. Wait until I catch him.
2120002040/One whore has syphilis. Wonder which...?
2120002041/Scram!
2120002042/What you looking at?
2120002043/Scram, mongrel!
2120002044/The guards are preparing a roundup.
2120002045/Must kill for some fun. Heheh!
2120002046/Seems you seek trouble.
2120002047/Damn those drowned dead - can't drink by the waterside.
2120002048/Looking for trouble? Go to the crypt.
2120002049/If you've a sister, bring her here.
2120002050/I'll piss in the dwarf blacksmith's bellows for a prank.
2120002051/Teach me to kill.
2120002052/The Beast scares folk so they pee themselves.
2120002053/I want a sword like that.
2120002054/Are you my uncle? Have you got a sugar doll?
2120002055/Are you a monster, too?
2120002056/My sister and my mum stayed at the Grand Master's.
2120002057/I'd rather not worry mum, but we're gonna die.
2120002058/If I were king, I'd never let the Order release its monsters against humans.
2120002059/Dad sold mum's jewels so we could eat along the way.
2120002060/I dreamt of the same monster we saw by the town hall.
2120002061/I like staring at fires.
2120002062/I don't like you.
2120002063/You're saying that to make me feel better. No one can kill all the beasts.
2120002064/I'm not scared. A monster killed dad, so I need to protect mum.
2120002065/You'll die if you go further.
2120002066/Dad said we'll move to the cloister soon.
2120002067/They say you'll eat your fill at the Grand Master's.
2120002068/When I grow up, I'll be one of the Grand Master's knights.
2120002069/A knight patted my sister on the head and told her not to cry.
2120002070/Help!
2120002071/My legs hurt...
2120002072/Boom tarara!
2120002073/Hey!
2120002074/Dad promised me a sword like yours!
2120002075/Ooo! A witcher!
2120002076/Dad! Help!
2120002077/Ugh...
2120002078/Oh... it's raining...
2120002079/Stop, stupid rain!
2120002080/Everything's wet.
2120002081/It'll be mighty muddy.
2120002082/Sure it's dead?
2120002083/Help me! Help!
2120002084/This is boring.
2120002085/My legs hurt...
2120002086/I'm not playing that.
2120002087/Dad! Help!
2120002088/I don't want that.
2120002089/It'll be mighty muddy!
2120002090/Stop, you stupid rain!
2120002091/Everything's getting wet.
2120002092/It's going to be so muddy.
2120002093/He spends his evenings wandering the nonhuman district.
2120002094/Mr. Maarloeve's not home.
2120002095/I like Raymond, so I look after his house.
2120002096/Gimme an oren.
2120002097/I know where to find him.
2120002098/You don't live here.
2120002099/Raymond said he has some new information. Come to his house as soon as you can.
2120002100/Mr. Maarloeve sent me.
2120002101/I will fall on my face into dust. The Lords approach like rising waters...
2120002102/They ascend like kings to the throne...
2120002103/I call thee from the depths! Come...
2120002104/The Lords are coming.
2120002105/Who is above the Lords?
2120002106/For I tell thee, who is above the Lords?
2120002107/The Beast says boo!
2120002108/Fangs galore.
2120002109/Run away if you can!
2120002110/I don't wanna be a guard!
2120002111/Let's play "Slitting throats" instead.
2120002112/The messenger of the Lords lifts me from my knees and tears off my chains!
2120002113/I sat on foreign shores, crying and remembering my fatherland.
2120002114/Blessed be the messenger of the Deep.
2120002115/Blessed be he who wields a sword against my enemies.
2120002116/Who is above the Lords?!
2120002117/Mooooommm!
2120002118/You're no witch!
2120002119/Ha, nothing happened.
2120002120/I'll be Borse!
2120002121/Sweet Lindella, my heart's mistress, accepteth thou this rutabaga?
2120002122/Like what then?
2120002123/I'll be a knight.
2120002124/Cuteth I with an axe or a sword?
2120002125/Marrieth I or killeth her? What a question!
2120002126/The griggs put a spell on me. I had cat whiskers 'til yesterday.
2120002127/Mum caught dad with a rusalka and screamed at him terribly!
2120002128/I'm off to chase griggs.
2120002129/I knew that braggart was lying.
2120002130/Can Alvin truly disappear, then reappear in the same place but yesterday?
2120002131/Only the field griggs drink more than my father!
2120002132/From him! You see, I broke two clay jugs yesterday and I'll be spanked for it today unless he can go back and stop me.
2120002133/Geralt...
2120002134/We should never grow accustomed to violence and horror, especially the sensitive among us.
2120002135/Gods dammit, Geralt... I can't believe what I'm seeing.
2120002136/Probably the site of the heaviest fighting. Then there's the plague...
2120002137/I'd never desert you. I want to help!
2120002138/Nose to the ground, forging on, you're like a bloodhound on a fresh trail.
2120002139/I hope you don't think I'm scared.
2120002140/Shut up and tell me what we're doing.
2120002141/That will be neither easy nor safe.
2120002142/Geralt, do I cramp your style, get in the way of your monster slaying?
2120002143/We arrive in Vizima soon.
2120002144/Yeah... Smoke. Something's burning.
2120002145/Dammit, Geralt! Look!
2120002146/Who? Me?!
2120002147/I'm no spy! I'm a poet! Geralt, don't let these sons-of-bitches...
2120002148/What's going on?
2120002149/Why do I think you're up to something?
2120002150/Foltest will be glad. Negotiations with Radovid are apparently going well and it seems we're gaining another strong ally.
2120002151/The pen is mightier than the sword. And you'll never change either... Off to save the world again when nobody's asked you...
2120002152/With the kingdom in flames, Foltest struck a deal with his neighbors.
2120002153/I understand. Good luck.
2120002154/Then bold Foltest uttered these words: "Virtuous Radovid..."
2120002155/I'm trying to keep a faithful and accurate record of these events.
2120002156/Geralt, you have no sense of poetry. There's the truth of time and the truth of legend...
2120002157/Be careful, Geralt.
2120002158/When in Vizima, I'm a Temerian patriot.
2120002159/You sure? Foltest already has an ally in Radovid of Redania.
2120002160/Geralt, you've arrived at a moment that should be called nothing short of historic...
2120002161/More important than a Temerian-Redanian alliance with far-reaching consequences?
2120002162/In front of Siegfried? I thought the Order was out of favor.
2120002163/Allow me some common courtesy. Triss, my joy at this meeting...
2120002164/All right, let me tell you quickly, before Yaevinn's arrested.
2120002165/Forgive me, but I must fulfill my chronicler's duty.
2120002166/You've come a long way, Geralt. What do you intend to do now?
2120002167/That's something we'll never know.
2120002168/As I thought. I've known you for years and never seen such fatigue in your eyes. People expected too much of you, yet as always you rose to the challenge, no matter how unreasonable it seemed.
2120002169/That's something new... You returned from the netherworld, got entangled in a real mess. You faced beasts and bastards who did you harm. And you're telling me life is beautiful?
2120002170/What's next, Geralt?
2120002171/She's fine. She stayed by you until I arrived. Then she had to go. You know, political duties...
2120002172/So, did you recover everything?
2120002173/Not to be trite, but as always, you'll be the leaf carried by the wind.
2120002174/On an eternal voyage in search of purpose and meaning.
2120002175/What can I say... Godspeed on your path, witcher.
2120002176/He was here a second ago, keeping an eye on you until I arrived. Then duty called.
2120002177/He was here a second ago, keeping an eye on you until I arrived. Then he had to go.
2120002178/Well, I hope. What about you? Did you succeed?
2120002179/You're awake, Geralt. I was getting worried.
2120002180/Come now. You've recovered what was stolen, punished those who hurt you. You played politics and dismantled conspiracies. You've loved, you've killed...
2120002181/A true keepsake, perhaps.
2120002182/The one you gave Alvin?
2120002183/No doubt. After all, the nonhumans tipped the scales in Foltest's favor. What about you? Did you succeed?
2120002184/Don't get me wrong, I'm overjoyed to be able to talk to you again, but perhaps you should have stayed there, on the Isle of Avallach.
2120002185/Born anew, baptized in blood and fire.
2120002186/A few steps away. He's dead...
2120002187/Well, you missed a few things. The rebellion's been quelled and Foltest has regained control of the city... with assistance from the Order.
2120002188/Take what's yours, witcher. You earned it.
2120002189/Long enough. The fighting has been quelled, Foltest has regained control. However Triss supported him, the effects have been shocking.
2120002190/What about you? Did you succeed?
2120002191/Long enough. The Order's been smashed to bits and Foltest has regained control.
2120002192/For a minute there I thought you were gone, too.
2120002193/Hey! I'm just a poet!
2120002194/Geralt, what woman will look at you if continue to you wear that?
2120002195/Geralt, dammit, you get more and more famous every day!
2120002196/You wanna talk?
2120002197/Don't be ridiculous, Geralt.
2120002198/Help!
2120002199/So what do we do now, Geralt?
2120002200/It seemed the conflict between the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia'tael would turn Vizima into charred ruins.
2120002201/He let the two sides bleed each other.
2120002202/The flower of elven youth perished, fighting in Vizima's streets.
2120002203/Yet they chose to remain silent.
2120002204/Few people knew what had actually happened in those days in Vizima.
2120002205/That is a different tale entirely.
2120002206/The nonhuman uprising weakened Temeria and Foltest realized he would need capable diplomats.
2120002207/The king punished or exiled those who had plotted against him in his absence.
2120002208/Common folk saw no difference...
2120002209/Foltest, however, found a solution.
2120002210/The Order's power waned quickly following the Grand Master's mysterious death.
2120002211/There were no victors...
2120002212/They were those who Destiny had brought together with Geralt of Rivia...
2120002213/What then happened to the witcher?
2120002214/Triss Merigold became a royal advisor, sorceresses gained influence.
2120002215/They were, of course, soon replaced by others.
2120002216/They were too busy licking their wounds, seeking loved ones.
2120002217/The bloody fighting in Vizima revealed Jacques de Aldersberg's madness.
2120002218/Foltest took advantage and limited the Order's power.
2120002219/Yet the king's mercy was short-lived.
2120002220/People ceased trusting knights of the Order, began treating them like enemies.
2120002221/He forgave the nonhuman's their mutiny, as they assisted him in quelling the Order's rebellion.
2120002222/And it could not quell disdain and hatred.
2120002223/That is a different tale entirely.
2120002224/The sorceresses failed to gain influence over Foltest.
2120002225/Yet they chose to remain silent.
2120002226/Few knew what had really happened in those days in Vizima.
2120002227/In time, all returned to normal.
2120002228/Scoia'tael units soon reappeared along forest roads.
2120002229/Yaevinn's fame as the one who had defeated the Order drew more elven youth to his cause.
2120002230/The wartime chaos brought only misery.
2120002231/They were those who Destiny had brought together with Geralt of Rivia...
2120002232/What then happened to the witcher?
2120002233/Both the righteous and the villainous survived.
2120002234/Jacques de Aldersberg's funeral drew masses.
2120002235/The bloody street fighting ended, people saw the knights as heroes.
2120002236/The king's edicts punishing the Scoia'tael caused a mass exodus of elves and dwarves.
2120002237/All wished to bid farewell to the man who had saved Vizima.
2120002238/Nonhumans faced greater hatred than they did before the rebellion.
2120002239/History can at times be cruel.
2120002240/The sorceresses failed to consolidate theirs at the court of King Foltest.
2120002241/New fortunes were made amidst the ruins.
2120002242/The king turned a blind eye to the iniquities of the Order of the Flaming Rose.
2120002243/Yet they chose to remain silent.
2120002244/Few knew what had really happened in those days in Vizima.
2120002245/That is a different tale entirely.
2120002246/The new Grand Master, Siegfried of Denesle, reformed the Order, consolidated its power.
2120002247/The king punished or exiled those who had plotted against him in his absence.
2120002248/They were those who Destiny had brought together with Geralt of Rivia...
2120002249/Some won, others lost. The natural order of things.
2120002250/What then happened to the witcher?
2120002251/Grinning madly, wagging gladly, bouncing with delight.
2120002252/Must be that still not wed, that is why so jolly.
2120002253/My, oh my, what a sight! Why no melancholy?
2120002254/Aaaoooo, aaoooo, aoooooo!!!!
2120002255/Looking down, awful frown, crying like a dog.
2120002256/Must be that freshly wed or lately engaged.
2120002257/Why is this mighty beast so badly rampaged?
2120002258/Aaooooo, aoooooo, aoooooo!
2120002259/By the woods can you see, Wolf in all his might,
2120002260/In the grass can you see, Wolf just limps along,
2120002261/Your home all surrounded by snow,
2120002262/When the spring comes along with the rain,
2120002263/Autumn's scents have pervaded the air,
2120002264/This yearning and grief on your face.
2120002265/That's the way it must be, please don't show,
2120002266/The wind stole the words from our lips,
2120002267/Glassy frost covers rivers and lakes,
2120002268/Those diamonds that run down your cheeks.
2120002269/The sun will warm up us both,
2120002270/That's the way it must be, please don't shed,
2120002271/Yet with ladies and maples, there's no need to frown,
2120002272/Like them maples reaching higher,
2120002273/Lay them down, on the ground,
2120002274/And the game is done.
2120002275/It's no wonder dazzling ladies are so hard to score,
2120002276/More it takes to soar.
2120002277/A few surviving elven and dwarven units sought refuge amidst forests, where they prepared for a final, desperate fight.
2120002278/The Northern Kingdoms nursed their wounds for five years after the Great War.
2120002279/In cities and villages, folk were left wondering: What had happened to the witchers?
2120002280/The Blue Mountains in the north of Kaedwen. The year 1270 - five years after the Great War.
2120002281/Plague and famine raged, the death toll unknown...
2120002282/Abominable beasts ruled backwoods, highways, and former battlefields alike.
2120002283/C'mon, Shani, let it go. Carmen's good.
2120002284/No need, Geralt, we've met. Hello, Carmen.
2120002285/How did you and Geralt end up in such a compromising position?
2120002286/Oo! Show me!
2120002287/You won't get off that easy. Downstairs, now!
2120002288/I wonder what granny did when she was younger... bet she was a real player.
2120002289/Here's to granny!
2120002290/All right, I'll start. Shani, remember when I walked in on you and Geralt in Oxenfurt...
2120002291/Oo... like sexual dares?
2120002292/I never turn down Carmen when she proposes a game.
2120002293/Am I losing my mind? Is this a joke? Shani?!
2120002294/But how? I saw it myself...
2120002295/You really don't remember a thing... Your loved ones, your friends.
2120002296/Geralt? I'll be damned! For a second there I thought I was seeing a ghost.
2120002297/No, I saw... during the massacre in Rivia, this curly-haired devil stuck a pitchfork in your stomach. I saw you die! No one could help you. Even...
2120002298/I saw her tell them to put you on a boat, and there was a unicorn, and Milva, Cahir and Angouleme, and Yarpen and Zoltan -- we all witnessed it...
2120002299/We were all there.
2120002300/Whatever you say, but this is incredible.
2120002301/Five years ago, we were sitting in a tavern with friends, eating escargot, drinking vodka... A bloodthirsty mob attacked the nonhuman district. You went out into the street to scare them off. And then...
2120002302/Someone stabbed you in the stomach with a pitchfork - a fatal wound. There was nothing we could do.
2120002303/It's the truth and nothing but. Geralt, forgive me... I still can't believe you're here.
2120002304/How do I know you're not some magic doppelganger, some freak?
2120002305/Hm.
2120002306/You're right. We've been through too much together. I'd know...
2120002307/Let's have a drink.
2120002308/What about higher vampires?
2120002309/I've been thinking and I have a question.
2120002310/Let me show you what drinking blood means to a higher vampire.
2120002311/Cheers!
2120002312/Let's imagine your next contract is a vampire. What would you do?
2120002313/Ha, what if I said you'd reach a deal with this vampire?
2120002314/And what if the vampire doesn't care to drink blood?
2120002315/Ah, strong, but good.
2120002316/Let me show you what drinking blood means to a vampire.
2120002317/I just did with that last shot. Listen to a man who has lived a little and not lost his memory. Higher vampires treat blood like we treat...
2120002318/Let's have a drink, Geralt.
2120002319/Yes?
2120002320/Actually you did, so the joke's on you. In any case, it's true - you were friends with a vampire. Zoltan would back me up if he were here. Do you remember Regis?
2120002321/Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy died fighting by your side, Geralt. Let's drink to him and others who have fallen.
2120002322/Listen, Geralt. Unlike the lesser ones, higher vampires don't need blood. Human or otherwise. Blood, my dear monster slayer, is like booze to them.
2120002323/Geralt, you had a true friend who was a vampire.
2120002324/Here's to all divine mistakes...
2120002325/So, I was about to enlighten you... The superstitions concerning higher vampires...
2120002326/This is serious, Geralt. Unlike the lesser ones, higher vampires don't need blood. Human or otherwise. Blood, my dear monster slayer, is like booze to them.
2120002327/Actually you did, so the joke's on you. In any case, it's true - we traveled a long way, for many months, with a higher vampire as our companion. Do you remember Regis?
2120002328/Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy died fighting by your side, Geralt. Let's drink to him and others who have fallen.
2120002329/For he's a jolly good fellow...
2120002330/Whatever you say.
2120002331/Geralt, you had a true friend who was a vampire.
2120002332/I swear it's true.
2120002333/Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy died fighting by your side, Geralt. Let's drink to him and others who have fallen.
2120002334/Let's drink to our mistakes...
2120002335/Geralt, you had a true friend who was a vampire.
2120002336/Actually you did, so the joke's on you. In any case, this vampire's name was Regis. Zoltan can back me up.
2120002337/So as I was saying... Unlike the lesser ones, higher vampires don't need blood. Human or otherwise. Blood, my dear monster slayer, is like booze to them.
2120002338/Drink up...
2120002339/Enough, I said. See you.
2120002340/So, Carmen, how's business these days?
2120002341/Carmen, what would you say to a song...?
2120002342/Shani, don't be a prig...
2120002343/Party's over, I guess...
2120002344/You have a beautiful voice, Siegfried.
2120002345/I think I know the perfect song for this occasion...
2120002346/Our time has come.
2120002347/I suppose...
2120002348/Zoltan, how's the wife?
2120002349/To Shani...
2120002350/I think I know the perfect song for Zoltan.
2120002351/Time to go.
2120002352/Splendid, Zoltan and I have always gotten along.
2120002353/Frankly, I don't like those pompous zealots.
2120002354/Let's have a drink!
2120002355/Here's to all of you!
2120002356/Stiff stuff.
2120002357/It depends. For a romantic dinner for two, booze won't do. Not so much for the taste, but because of the aftereffects.
2120002358/Zoltan, did you know that Broover Hoog recovered miraculously this spring?
2120002359/Hey, Zoltan!
2120002360/Zoltan's right. We need some lard.
2120002361/That mummy must have some lard, maybe pickles, too.
2120002362/Ha, I don't suppose you'd be so responsive to your king's will if he imposed taxes on you.
2120002363/In line with that same ideal, all elves and dwarves are criminals, right?
2120002364/As I see it, the quarantine is how Foltest is paying off his war debt to the merchants. Ordinary folks can't pass, only those with connections...
2120002365/Geralt, you support this lousy, anti-elven propaganda?
2120002366/Shani was a medic at the Battle of Brenna - she's seen more corpses than all of us put together.
2120002367/Oo, for a second there, I thought you might not be you after all.
2120002368/I don't believe I'm hearing this. What about dwarves - Zoltan, for instance?
2120002369/Dandelion, known in some circles as a master of melody and verse...
2120002370/What about nonhumans?
2120002371/Geralt, I can’t listen to this, say something...
2120002372/You don't have to be Dijkstra to know how the Order treats nonhumans.
2120002373/Geralt! I'm giving a concert tonight.
2120002374/Hey, couldn't stay away from the dice?
2120002375/Thanks in no small part to you. Want to play dice, kill some time?
2120002376/It's the one I got from Toruviel in the Valley of Flowers, remember?
2120002377/Uhh... forgot how tough you were. Hic-cup.
2120002378/Geralt...
2120002379/Geralt, I promised to perform for all these people! And I don't have my lute.
2120002380/Uuum... all right. Truth is, he's got reasons to dislike me.
2120002381/Geralt! I'm glad you're here!
2120002382/I guess... My lute's at the home of a rich merchant. The house is on the west side of Salt Square. And I can't possibly leave - the crowd awaits!
2120002383/Well, the merchant caught me giving his daughter lessons.
2120002384/Relax, Geralt. Music...
2120002385/Great! I owe you one. I need to prepare.
2120002386/Geralt! The crowd is getting rowdy!
2120002387/Will you hurry?
2120002388/Wonderful!
2120002389/I'm off to practice a bit. See you!
2120002390/The she-elf from the Blue Mountains... You did quite a number on her nose when you two first met.
2120002391/I heard she joined the Scoia'tael. I wonder if she's still alive.
2120002392/I even wrote a ballad about that... "Where the Devil Says Goodnight"... I'll be singing it today.
2120002393/Great. So you know why I want that lute back.
2120002394/Let's say his daughter and I got to know each other... without permission.
2120002395/Luckily, last time I visited I made her pretty happy, so she hid the lute for me in a trunk on the upper floor.
2120002396/After eight at night. Come if you want.
2120002397/Personal charm and fame open a lot of doors.
2120002398/With all the right contacts, he obtained a pass for me, thus demonstrating his appreciation for art. Sadly, we're no longer friends...
2120002399/Geralt, you know so little... I approached a wealthy merchant whose daughter studied lute under me.
2120002400/Hm, long story... Tell you over a drink?
2120002401/Hm, long story... Tell you over a drink?
2120002402/Start with a warm up. A-hem. La la la la la la la....
2120002403/...I could use a vodka...
2120002404/Not now, Geralt, please...
2120002405/...Pass the bottle, pass a cup...
2120002406/...Down the hatch and bottoms up!
2120002407/Okay, I'll leave the boy with Triss.
2120002408/Okay, I'll leave the boy with Shani.
2120002409/Quick, Geralt! There's no time to lose.
2120002410/I'll take the kid wherever you want.
2120002411/Oo, doubt that'll make Shani happy... But it's better than angering a sorceress, I guess...
2120002412/Whatever you say, but I'd avoid angering a sorceress if I were you.
2120002413/You heard them outside? Amazing! Okay, I'll take him, but where?
2120002414/Whoa, that's a lot of blood. Geralt... And here's the boy. See, where would you be without me?
2120002415/You'll be proud of me... Oblivious to any danger, I decided to help the kid and followed them. They dragged him to this house...
2120002416/Told you. You have to take me with you this time, this is true ballad material. Matter of fact, I'll lead you there. The house is in the nonhuman district, follow me.
2120002417/Geralt! I was looking for you... I had no idea Nurse Natala was such a wellspring of passion. You ever seen her leaning over patients? Those eyes...
2120002418/In any case, I was on my way here to entertain Natala with some scintillating conversation when I passed these two odd-looking men dragging out this kid who was hollering and crying. They called him by his name -- I think it was Alpin or Albin or something...
2120002419/Geralt, hurry!
2120002420/Okay... I guess poetry requires sacrifices.
2120002421/You always tell me to wait outside. No, this time I'm going in with you. I'll create a new genre - the proactive ballad...
2120002422/This is where they brought Alvin.
2120002423/Just asking... Something troubling you?
2120002424/Let's go. Can't talk about women on an empty stomach...
2120002425/We'll talk at the tavern.
2120002426/No buts. Zoltan and I agreed to have a drink today.
2120002427/Geralt! How's Alvin?
2120002428/Oo, delicious. Nothing like a good belt of liquor.
2120002429/Hey, Zoltan.
2120002430/Eewh! Strong enough to make you cry. I'll tell you what's up with dames. You can theorize all you want but you'll never figure out what's going on inside their heads. There's just no understanding women!
2120002431/Don't try to tell me you don't want to. The girls there are discreet, and they really know what they're doing...
2120002432/I believe that.
2120002433/That's where you're wrong, Geralt. We're your only friends, and friends help each other. You'll see. We'll have a drink, and you'll know exactly what to do about Shani.
2120002434/Only the weight of your purse counts at the House of the Night. Besides, the madam owes me a favor. Come on, Geralt, live a little...
2120002435/I know, let's go to a whorehouse, make it your stag night.
2120002436/Sure they do, it's the best whorehouse in Temeria.... So, Geralt, you coming?
2120002437/Hmmpf, enough about death, hmmpf, let's change the subject, I've started thinking morbid thoughts.
2120002438/I went there all the time, nothing ever happened to me...
2120002439/I'm telling you, nothing like a trip to the whorehouse to get you thinking clearly....
2120002440/I know, I know, none of them ever died of old age.
2120002441/Sneer away, but you won't put me off. The problem is you don't know what you want.
2120002442/Ha! I knew it!
2120002443/Geralt is experiencing cognitive dissonance, a rather unpleasant tension that accompanies the appearance of two conflicting cognitions, be they thoughts or judgments...
2120002444/I've never had a family, but I am a poet. I know something about people. Tell me this: do you want a family or not?
2120002445/That's where you're wrong, Geralt. We're your only friends, and friends help each other. You'll see. We'll have a drink, and you'll know exactly what to do about Triss.
2120002446/Answer the question. You know what I mean. If it weren't for this mess - Scoia'tael, the Order, Salamandra...
2120002447/Oo, the vodka's nicely chilled. Gentlemen... cheers!
2120002448/Who put that into your head?
2120002449/But?
2120002450/Damn it, I don't get it! What's one got to do with the other? No one said you'd have to stop slaying monsters, right?
2120002451/Will you stop whimpering like a spoiled lass and spit it out?
2120002452/I've heard that tone before...
2120002453/Like the old days. Try as we might, we just can't seem to cull the population of vicious SOB's.
2120002454/Be careful.
2120002455/Geralt?
2120002456/His breast heaves, yet cold it remains. His lips move, his eyes engrossed. Returned to the world, but detained by death. Who is this man?
2120002457/What if she could see her sister?
2120002458/How did you get here?
2120002459/Geralt, not to disappoint you, but you need to practice before you're anywhere near my level.
2120002460/Geralt, is that you? How are things?
2120002461/Who knows? I left soon after you. Though I did hear that you staged quite a bloodbath.
2120002462/His lips sealed, his eyes blank, his breast stone-cold, his heart has ceased.
2120002463/Still in this world, yet no longer a part! Who is this man?
2120002464/Best see the fisherman. He'll take it to Vizima.
2120002465/By some stroke of chance, Alina acquired a Nehalennia's Mirror - a rare and powerful device used by prophets and oracles. It could foretell the future accurately, though sometimes confusingly. Alina consulted her mirror often...
2120002466/Hm, not your everyday commission, but I'm a professional. Any instructions?
2120002467/Triss teleported me too. It was amazing. I always wanted to see what it's like.
2120002468/So why did Triss teleport you here?
2120002469/Stop sulking. It worked, didn't it? Gave me an idea. I'll develop that theme into an epic work about folk customs...
2120002470/Is that so...? Well, I just remembered I had a package for you...
2120002471/Well done, Geralt! I would've warned you, but I had to rely on a sudden inspiration...
2120002472/Sooo... what should I write about?
2120002473/Uhhh, isn't her wedding the day after tomorrow?
2120002474/Good idea. I have pen and parchment. Think of a beginning.
2120002475/New life comes as hope springs true. His soul shines, by memory embraced. The dead returns to the land of his youth, to seek his beloved's face.
2120002476/Exactly. I guess Alina's mirror wasn't polite. Maybe if...
2120002477/M'lday, Geralt and I have devised a short poem for two voices. Care to listen?
2120002478/Yes. Oh! I just remembered - Triss said you should watch him since others are after him. Or something like that.
2120002479/I'll need time...
2120002480/Fine. I have a letter to you from your lover.
2120002481/In any case, what a truly delightful place. Triss said we should stay here until Princess Adda stops dreaming of slitting your throat.
2120002482/Interesting, perhaps I'll use it in my new ballad.
2120002483/Maybe it lost its power...
2120002484/Right. Shoot.
2120002485/Well, yes. Unless he has a twin...
2120002486/Now don't get offended, but has killing people become a pleasure for you?
2120002487/I don't know, something, but I might've lost it...
2120002488/You've changed... for the worse. Thanks for darkening my day.
2120002489/Geralt!
2120002490/Well, there's going to be a wedding. Alina, the village mayor's daughter, will marry Julian, a wealthy merchant from Kovir. Then there are the vodyanoi... Oh! Alina's taking care of Alvin.
2120002491/It's a charming area thoroughly magical in its mood. The peasants seem altogether happy, while the peasant women are... mmmmmmm...
2120002492/...she'll realize who she is. Call me when you need me.
2120002493/Celina... That stormy hair we all know, a hand raised to her lips, it's Alina, Alina, her fingertips... Something's not right there...
2120002494/Could we do this tomorrow?
2120002495/I'm sure she's worried about him.
2120002496/Not as well as you think. You'll see...
2120002497/It's wonderful. Wine, women, song and dice through the night...
2120002498/You're the corpse... My lady, forgive me. A hornet stung my friend in the ear, venom went to his brain... Ceased-corpse, nice rhyme. Geralt, try again.
2120002499/Come on, you're like a brother. I wouldn't have the heart to skin you. Come see me when you've gotten some practice.
2120002500/Hmmm... I beg the lady's forgiveness, but the gods did not make all of us sensitive... Geralt, get it together!
2120002501/When I'm done with you, you'll be looking for solace among the elves. One of them's not bad, actually.
2120002502/People here go wild for it. It's incredible.
2120002503/Play for me, the minstrel said, but the cymbalists faced him in dread... hmmm, now a rhyme for dread, any ideas?
2120002504/Ha ha ha! Prime jest, we all laughed. See any noonwraiths? No? Good. Now, seriously...
2120002505/Don't get skinned. Some locals think of themselves as professionals. They won't play with just anyone.
2120002506/Your brain is dead... Try harder, witcher...
2120002507/I see... Your feelings for her have waned.
2120002508/Start with Tobias Hoffman or Julian.
2120002509/Engaging, and straight from life. I changed my mind, see? Poets don't need to embellish. Life is colorful enough...
2120002510/No problem. But to do it right I need to know who it's for...
2120002511/Your romance is blooming. I'm happy for you, Geralt.
2120002512/Sometimes at night Adam listens close. 'Tis Celina's, Celina's, Celina's ghost... Lovely, wouldn't you say?
2120002513/Try me. Some say I'm as good at poker as I am at poetry.
2120002514/Hilarious. Now I need to think.
2120002515/Alvin... Wait a minute, Triss wanted me to do something, hammered it into my head for an hour... Ah, yeah! I have a dimeritium amulet for him.
2120002516/Geralt, I'm fresh out of ideas... Try an expert - the Lady of the Lake or a soothsayer.
2120002517/She could find that interesting. Sit down and write it. The fisherman could take it to Vizima.
2120002518/I don't think so. Now to the tavern to meet some charming lass who'll get my spirits up...
2120002519/It'll be a masterpiece in verse... interesting, horrifying, romantic...
2120002520/Iambic or dactylic? Or maybe something new? I'm feeling uninspired, what a nightmare!
2120002521/I won't judge you, I just hope you know what you're doing.
2120002522/Geralt?
2120002523/Geralt... Alvin's one of the hostages.
2120002524/Geralt, what now? Leaving's not an option, you'd make enemies of both the Order and the nonhumans.
2120002525/You'll manage. See you.
2120002526/We need to get back to Vizima. Triss might have some ideas.
2120002527/After you...
2120002528/What happened?
2120002529/Scoia'tael on one side, the Order on the other, and us in the middle with Alvin.
2120002530/Geralt!
2120002531/Toruviel's elves have taken hostages in the village. What do we do?
2120002532/Play for me, the minstrel said, but the cymbalists faced him in dread... Hmm, now a rhyme for dread... Any ideas?
2120002533/Clues?
2120002534/He feared neither sorcerer nor the hosts of the damned...
2120002535/All right. I'll keep a lookout behind the village mayor's house. When you're ready, come tell me what to do.
2120002536/And walked bravely on, his destiny to meet!
2120002537/What should I do?
2120002538/Sure.
2120002539/Don't get involved, Geralt. Nothing good ever comes of it...
2120002540/All right. See you at the lakeside.
2120002541/Witcher, this feels like a pivotal moment, what you do will have consequences. So, do we grab Alvin and leave them to it?
2120002542/What is it, wanderer?
2120002543/In truth?
2120002544/After the rebellion, we'll lead our Green March unto the foot of the royal castle.
2120002545/We're planning our protest against logging and the murder of endangered species...
2120002546/During our march, leaves of fool's parsley will symbolize life. May these Swallow potions restore your life.
2120002547/Sapphires shine like the star-lit sky during a full moon. Take these potions in return.
2120002548/Our slogans inscribed on a red shawl will strike like thunder with devastating effect. In return, accept this Thunderbolt potion.
2120002549/We'll protest until the king hears us. We've prepared our chants, like "Hey ho, logging must go" or "Animal murder stops now."
2120002550/We do, if you supply our needs in return.
2120002551/Excellent! We have a crown jewel.
2120002552/Excellent. Red symbolizes the blood of tormented farm animals.
2120002553/Wonderful. Gold symbolizes the sun that gives life to animals and plants.
2120002554/We will inscribe our demands upon this beautiful gift, this shawl. In exchange, take this Blizzard potion.
2120002555/The blood red ruby calls to mind White Raffard's Decoction.
2120002556/The diamond is the clearest of stones. These potions will help you see your enemies, even in darkest night.
2120002557/Splendid. And now I must attend to the details of our protest.
2120002558/I must see if what you've brought can be used for our banners.
2120002559/We need fool's parsley leaves, white roses, precious stones and all sorts of shawls... of natural fibers. We want no magic.
2120002560/Since you brought what we need, you shall receive potions in return.
2120002561/Oh, yes! Our banner!
2120002562/Good night.
2120002563/Fool's parsely? Let's have it.
2120002564/Thank you, witcher, for supporting our cause.
2120002565/Amber stands for the sea, ever in motion and unstoppable. To be like the sea, take this potion known as Willow.
2120002566/White roses symbolize purity, so we offer you White Honey.
2120002567/We cannot. Nature calls for help!
2120002568/Foltest is no beggar. We must ensure all know it's not an effigy of any old man.
2120002569/On this golden shawl our slogans will shine like the sun. Accept this Cat potion which will aid you in the dark.
2120002570/Leave us be, we're planning our Green March.
2120002571/Wonderful. We shall use it for our effigy of Foltest.
2120002572/Impressive. The white roses were the weakest link in our plan.
2120002573/Splendid!
2120002574/Tremendous. Rubies will convince all that our effigy is Foltest.
2120002575/Isn't it obvious? White roses will encourage those fighting to make peace. We shall use shawls and kerchiefs as banners with slogans.
2120002576/Pester me no more. Goodbye.
2120002577/From the precious stones we will make an effigy of King Foltest to burn if he refuses to hear us.
2120002578/My, you understand little. We will wave parsley leaves in the air - for the Green March. Townsfolk will bear them as a sign of their alliance with nature.
2120002579/And do you have fool's parsley, gemstones, shawls, or white roses?
2120002580/What is it, traveler?
2120002581/After the rebellion, we'll lead our Green March unto the foot of the royal castle.
2120002582/We're organizing a protest against logging and the murder of endangered species...
2120002583/We'll protest until the king hears us. We've prepared our chants, like "Hey ho, logging must go" or "Animal murder stops now."
2120002584/Good night.
2120002585/Nature calls for help!
2120002586/Indeed. We wish to eradicate the species, an aberration of the ecosystem. We'll need ten measures of blood.
2120002587/So dependable. Here's your payment.
2120002588/Splendid.
2120002589/You, here?
2120002590/I have learned much about a phenomenon of interest to you. The Wild Hunt.
2120002591/Praiseworthy. I, too, wished to offer Foltest my services as an advisor in these difficult times... Sadly, I could not get through burning Vizima.
2120002592/In folk culture, the King of the Wild Hunt embodies death. He is the one who takes away souls. He is oft considered as the tool of Destiny.
2120002593/Watch out for yourself, witcher.
2120002594/The Wild Hunt is an omen of war and tragedy. It has oft been seen recently near Vizima. Beware.
2120002595/Fight or shove off.
2120002596/Congratulations. Only a few have ever beaten me.
2120002597/Well then come back when you are.
2120002598/My tood! Where is my tood?!
2120002599/Ah, keep it... You beat me a second time. A true first.
2120002600/Congratulations, you win again.
2120002601/You lose.
2120002602/Geralt of Rivia, witcher, and for some time now, renowned fistfighter.
2120002603/Ready to fight?
2120002604/Swing away, then.
2120002605/I don't care.
2120002606/Call me Zdenek for now.
2120002607/Only because I reserve the right for a rematch each time. None has beaten me twice.
2120002608/Another time. I'm tired.
2120002609/Better luck next time.
2120002610/So you say. Care to challenge me?
2120002611/One fight per day. I'm old and tired.
2120002612/Everything will dry, it's unavoidable.
2120002613/I've gotten old.
2120002614/Damned noonwraiths.
2120002615/Greetings. What brings you here?
2120002616/Nice to see you, wanderer.
2120002617/Goat's offspring!
2120002618/Fight!
2120002619/I surrender!
2120002620/Run!
2120002621/Stay away!
2120002622/Hm.
2120002623/I'll lead.
2120002624/Mercy!
2120002625/Attack!
2120002626/I'll see through you!
2120002627/Onward! Show them where bears say goodnight!
2120002628/Hm, refreshment.
2120002629/The nerve!
2120002630/Oo, getting wet.
2120002631/Vampires and fleders fear garlic.
2120002632/Ask that madman, Gramps, who collects anything he finds. Might even have that book.
2120002633/People claim we burn intruders we trap in wicker cages. Nonsense.
2120002634/The woodcutters have abandoned their clearing. Stood up to the Salamanders, which proved their undoing.
2120002635/The Hierophant has returned. I'm certain he wishes to speak with you.
2120002636/You aid the brickmakers. I thought you could use the assistance.
2120002637/I've not seen him.
2120002638/Fools! Only adults are accepted here - children would only trouble us. As for dryads, ask them yourself.
2120002639/What is it?
2120002640/The Hierophant searches for new druid candidates.
2120002641/Look for yourself...
2120002642/He left to join other elves in the swamp.
2120002643/I wouldn't know.
2120002644/We can supply the herb at a reasonable price. Talk to the man who tends the holy oak.
2120002645/Are you a fool seeking a magical strength-giving beverage?
2120002646/The Circle of Power renders the soil fertile.
2120002647/Not all swamp creatures are dangerous. Many are endangered.
2120002648/It's called the Willow and will raise your resistance to being stunned and confused - very useful when you deal with brickmakers, heh heh.
2120002649/Stop disturbing me.
2120002650/Disease supposedly consumes the city. Alas, the woes of civilization!
2120002651/What was that recipe? A double dose of hellebore and a dash of chopped fool's parsely? Yes, this potion might prove useful.
2120002652/Return in the morning.
2120002653/Best wander around the swamp in daylight. There're fewer monsters when the sun shines.
2120002654/Old secrets are best left alone. That tower is cursed.
2120002655/Many. But common thieves and mages know not how to open the door.
2120002656/In the swamp, perhaps you've noticed old stones bearing strange symbols. They are nodes of powerful energy. Lines of energy intersect at a strange place.
2120002657/There is power inside. Alas, it cannot be penetrated.
2120002658/Come back when you're ready.
2120002659/What is it?
2120002660/Only the fool who tried to brush a wyvern's teeth.
2120002661/Not bad, eh?
2120002662/No, we cannot. Rather, we live by its rhythms.
2120002663/No... I mean yes... But not by force...
2120002664/Why do you need it?
2120002665/Will you attract it by whistling?
2120002666/Wyverns indeed.
2120002667/First fetch the rod and then we'll try the storm. Nature's patience is best not tested.
2120002668/Anyone magical can activate the three stone posts at the Golem Burial Ground. They attract lightning.
2120002669/Touch them while intending to attract a storm. But danger abounds - a careless instant can cost your life.
2120002670/It's no easy feat! I'm no common mage, harnessing storms with absurd stone posts.
2120002671/Sorry, there's been a misunderstanding... The storm with lightning is on its way. We'll send a gale as compensation.
2120002672/500 orens.
2120002673/I know your intention, witcher, and I would prepare, imbibe some of those potions for you'll need them.
2120002674/Goodnight.
2120002675/Don't make light of the sacred.
2120002676/And not an oren less.
2120002677/Things are getting more expensive and we have to live somehow.
2120002678/I can, but as I said...
2120002679/Any problems?
2120002680/Fortunately, that creature stands beyond the posts' range. Experimenting with nature's forces can only bring misfortune.
2120002681/Any other questions?
2120002682/Tamed them through hard work. I guarantee they're not drugged or their wings clipped. See for yourself.
2120002683/Yn Woedd Straede caem'eu aen Caerme.
2120002684/Yes?
2120002685/Do my eyes play tricks? Is it Geralt, the famed White Wolf?
2120002686/You're a witcher. You should know how to treat lycanthropy.
2120002687/Welcome.
2120002688/Be not afraid. My animal allies will help us.
2120002689/Excellent. I'll add it to the potion, then send the birds to deliver it.
2120002690/Not all, sadly. Rivers near cities are befouled with waste. Once great forests are logged without restraint. Animals that once thrived have become scarce.
2120002691/I'm uninterested in political conflicts. The druids prevail because we possess nothing that kings covet. They, in turn, know we pose no threat to their power.
2120002692/The Salamanders want a more potent version of their drug. For this I need the psilocybe. They pester me endlessly.
2120002693/Let's go.
2120002694/We're to meet in a clearing. My friend will come, too. It's the least I can do to help.
2120002695/I've heard about you from our friend, Mousesack.
2120002696/It has been a while since we last met.
2120002697/So may we depart?
2120002698/Possibly... Their leader wants us to use Nature's magic for his purposes. I'll propose a meeting where our chances will be even.
2120002699/There is also one folk remedy... I'm embarrassed to mention it but... It is said pure, unconditional love changes beasts into men.
2120002700/For some real poker.
2120002701/If I send them a sample, they will suspect nothing.
2120002702/You cannot enter their secret base. It is too well guarded, even for you.
2120002703/Let me know when you are.
2120002704/You might say so. My former poker partner, Mousesack, mentioned you.
2120002705/Yes. Gather five leaves of fool's parsley and tell the woman to weave them into a shirt. Then her lover should wear it for the night.
2120002706/They say you're clever. Let's see.
2120002707/When we meet the Salamander leader, I'll help your fight...
2120002708/We are grateful and will always lend you aid. I return to my brethren. Keep safe.
2120002709/Bring me a psilocybe mushroom. They grow in a cave guarded by cockatrices. I will create a potion to entice the Salamanders to meet us.
2120002710/A pity. Perhaps I can help. If you stay for a few years...
2120002711/I know several cures for lycanthropy, though I've not put any to the test myself.
2120002712/When you've had some practice, come see me.
2120002713/We could indeed play.
2120002714/You battle Salamandra, and have saved many from Salamandra's experiments.
2120002715/I know not how to prepare one. You should question an experienced alchemist. I have heard a shirt made with fool's parsley may help..
2120002716/Yes, we'll leave when you're ready.
2120002717/Welcome, White Wolf. I know what brings you here. I have heard it in the wind and seen it through animal eyes.
2120002718/We help all those in need as long as they respect our customs. The elves respect and understand Nature.
2120002719/The trees told me you slew every last one. We are very grateful, Wolf.
2120002720/Roland is dead. Search his body.
2120002721/If he is not, he'll continue the slaughter even once cured, remain nothing more than a monster.
2120002722/Before endeavoring to remove the curse, you must make sure the werewolf is still a man at heart.
2120002723/Remember this! Lycanthropy is a disease that penetrates ever deeper.
2120002724/Be ready. They will soon arrive.
2120002725/Come. Their arrival is imminent.
2120002726/At the end of your journey, the Grail may prove to be entirely different from what you initially expected it to be.
2120002727/Years of solitude have allowed me to copy some of my books many times over. I would be delighted to know these copies were of use to another.
2120002728/There are hundreds... but all right, three. The classic theory, of which I myself am a proponent; the conspiracy theory; and finally, one of the most mysterious - the philosophical or mystical. Which one first?
2120002729/These descendents, talented in the ways of magic, were protected by a secret organization before they ultimately mixed their own blood with that of Aen Seidhe, the Knowledgeable One.
2120002730/Anyone specific in mind?
2120002731/Know that the legend of the Holy Grail has been studied for centuries. It's been interpreted in myriad ways.
2120002732/I brought my library when I went into exile. I use the knowledge in the books of herbs to prepare potions for the people of Murky Waters, who provide food in exchange.
2120002733/Then you must speak with the Lady of the Lake or the local soothsayer. Only they might know how to solve this problem.
2120002734/Yet her influence is subtle and she never imposes her power.
2120002735/You seek the Holy Grail?
2120002736/Many fine knights set out seeking the Grail, abandoning their roles as guardians of peace and justice under the guidance of the Fisher King and the Lady of the Lake.
2120002737/Knights have been seeking the Grail for ages, yet none succeeded. Both the noble Lancel and the bold Bors failed. I heard even the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose has shown interest.
2120002738/I love her.
2120002739/I believe the Lady is not of this world. Mysteriously, she affects the entire area, safeguarding its people and granting them abundance.
2120002740/The vampire book describes alps, bruxae, fleders, and garkains. The hut will be your sanctuary and a place to store unneeded objects. Folk tales claim the wreath of immortelles can be useful in unusual ways.
2120002741/Bronze Dan concludes that the Grail is actually the descendents of the prophet Lebioda...
2120002742/All who drink from this miraculous cup are healed, fortified, and enlightened to understand the Truth.
2120002743/This chalice possesses the power to heal all diseases, poisonings, and wounds - "And pain will turn into power." One theory also states that in the hands of a rightful ruler, it can heal entire lands and protect their inhabitants from danger, creatures of the dark, natural disasters, and so forth.
2120002744/And?
2120002745/Remember this: the King of the Hunt is a powerful opponent, and no mortal, not even you, can hope to defeat him.
2120002746/The last stands empty, awaiting a new champion.
2120002747/Not so often. I see it as mental exercise.
2120002748/How can I help?
2120002749/I lead the life of a hermit with few luxuries, but make yourself at home.
2120002750/I can only state that I left when the Lady of the Lake summoned me to serve her.
2120002751/Alina gained possession of a rare and powerful item, a Nehalennia's Mirror. Nehalennia's Mirrors often served prophets and oracles for they foretold the future. Alina oft turned to her mirror for advice.
2120002752/Here's the key to its door.
2120002753/Now the Fisher King is mute and the knights gone. I think the Lady must be very lonely.
2120002754/Who has the Lady led to me?
2120002755/I can offer water, food and a game of dice.
2120002756/The Wild Hunt began haunting the ring recently. Its king hopes to lure the souls of the warriors laid in the kurgans by my hut.
2120002757/Correct. I spent most of my life serving King Foltest as a diplomat.
2120002758/Unfortunately, I know only what I garnered from my books.
2120002759/The Grail has no specific form or shape. It differs for each individual: it can be an object, an idea, a discovery. It can also be a search for the truth about oneself.
2120002760/Hmmm... the most esoteric. The Grail is a concept, a general understanding of Good. The search for the Grail is nothing beyond an ordinary quest for perfection.
2120002761/Which theory should I present next?
2120002762/The theory goes on to present the tempestuous and twisted fate of Sang-Real, but the author gets lost in his arguments, often contradicts himself... generally it turns into an unholy mess.
2120002763/Tis a group of crazed specters who traverse the heavens searching for souls like themselves. They are susceptible to magic, especially of the ritual kind.
2120002764/What is it?
2120002765/It has the power to dispel curses that hold nightwraiths.
2120002766/I serve the Lady and am more insightful than you think. I know you returned to the world of the living from death, presumably in search of something, but that is none of my concern. Just remember one thing...
2120002767/Find mandrake root by the kurgans near my hut. The magic herb will keep the King of the Hunt at bay. Merely light the candle that stands within the ring and sprinkle mandrake upon the flame.
2120002768/Indeed, that is how I serve the Lady. Her power is strong near the kurgans. At night sometimes, you can speak with the Lady's champions. From them, I draw wisdom and knowledge of past times.
2120002769/Handle it carefully and use it when the moment is right.
2120002770/Please also take this sack of holy salt. Carry it on you to fend off phantoms. It might prove useful.
2120002771/Kill nine phantoms, a hallowed number of the druids. Perhaps the appearance of a witcher will drive off the King of the Hunt. As your reward, you may have a book on vampires, ownership of a hut, or a wreath of immortelles.
2120002772/Precisely. Alina's mirror wasn't courteous.
2120002773/I know her to be a goddess. At times, I see her dressed in white, traversing the fields through morning fog, her bare feet stepping lightly over the dewy grass.
2120002774/May it serve you well.
2120002775/Splendid, I'm grateful. Which reward do you want?
2120002776/Slay nine phantoms within the druids' ring. They only appear at night. The King of the Hunt is the fiercest of them.
2120002777/A witcher. Here to deal with the noonwraiths?
2120002778/There's a druids' ring nearby with an ancient statue of the Goddess. The place is saturated with the Power and attracts dangerous entities.
2120002779/I do have a problem.
2120002780/Good choice. The Grail is a cup, a powerful magical object whose meaning cannot be fathomed by even the most powerful sorcerers.
2120002781/This was popularized by Bronze Dan and begins with a convoluted theory about the derivation of the word Grail. A few tortuous pages in, we learn the Holy Grail is actually Sang-Real, which in the elder tongue denotes royal, "hallowed blood."
2120002782/This theory claims the quest for the Grail to be the goal in itself. The result is of secondary importance.
2120002783/Knights who died serving the Lady over the ages. Gavander defended her honor against the Black Skull Knight. Elleverer perished at the foot of her altar fighting a water beast. Bors' tomb is symbolic, for the knight was lost on a holy mission. The last is for Reynard, an ordinary innkeeper who stopped customers from pissing in the lake...
2120002784/You know not how lonely a goddess. Do you think goddesses cannot be lonely? The gods ultimately created us in their own image.
2120002785/You might find it useful...
2120002786/I'm busy now.
2120002787/Don't do that!
2120002788/I wish to return...
2120002789/Everything grows...
2120002790/So green...
2120002791/No, white-haired one, that is not what I had in mind.
2120002792/No, please don't!
2120002793/Rain is good.
2120002794/Rain is good for plants.
2120002795/Yes, let it rain.
2120002796/Let it rain!
2120002797/What, White Wolf?
2120002798/Gwynbleidd.
2120002799/Curse you!
2120002800/Here to see me?
2120002801/Hm, interesting man.
2120002802/There was one... He asked about herbs, monsters, how much the mosses earn in town...
2120002803/Va faill, Gwynbleidd.
2120002804/Then he disappeared. Perhaps he encountered a powerful monster?
2120002805/Do you know where little dryads come from?
2120002806/Nonsense! Come back when you're wiser.
2120002807/Those children? They have long forgotten the struggle's meaning, craving blood and revenge, having only contempt for humans. They fail to see they begin to resemble the humans themselves. We merely defend our home, Gwynbleidd, and have no ambition of driving humans into the sea.
2120002808/White Wolf.
2120002809/Only girls can be dryads, no boys here.
2120002810/Witchers are sterile - we dryads don't acknowledge intimacy without procreation.
2120002811/I wish to remain faithful to Brokilon tradition. We only take in men to procreate and just the strong and agile. We want the girls born of their seed to inherit the fathers' fortitude.
2120002812/I believe you, but the ritual requires a man to prove himself a skilled hunter. Bring me a wolf's pelt.
2120002813/I would show you where young dryads come from, but...
2120002814/Like humans we have joys and sorrows, though our end is near. The war with the humans continues and our numbers diminish.
2120002815/Brokilon is our home, Eithne our lady. We live in harmony with the forest, flowing through the thickets and knowing the forest's secrets.
2120002816/Tis a secret. Though I'm taking the chance to visit this grove of old, beautiful trees.
2120002817/Yes. For the day.
2120002818/Hah! You treat concessions as weaknesses and believe acts of goodwill are traps. You'll never accept our otherness.
2120002819/Couples lost in pleasure become prey for monsters.
2120002820/Sadly, no. Perhaps my sisters from Brokilon could help, but they are far away.
2120002821/Our archers are matchless, but how long can we resist the brute force that rendered humans the world's rulers?
2120002822/Calm yourself. The mating ritual continues. Won't you try to entice me?
2120002823/Of course. The hunter returns... Do you have the wolf pelt I requested?
2120002824/Brokilon is the dryad homeland, a wilderness untouched by humans. Those surrounding Brokilon wish to claim our forests and thus, humans and dryads fight continuously along the borders.
2120002825/Gwynbleidd.
2120002826/I'm still angry.
2120002827/Some things are better forgotten. Nevertheless, I do feel sorry for you.
2120002828/Hmm... We dryads must be vigilant and agile to defend our home. And my body demands love...
2120002829/How?
2120002830/You have proved yourself a skilled hunter. Yet one obstacle remains.
2120002831/Your name precedes you.
2120002832/If you slay enough drowners he'll appear to discover the problem. Remember, drowners only venture out at night.
2120002833/I usually bathe in the lake, yet that night I dared the river near the village. Sadly, the drowners abide there, led by Zephyr!
2120002834/It is yours, though it's such a dull tome..
2120002835/I knew you would choose so! Always, when you come to me, I shall tend to your wounds.
2120002836/Welcome, warrior.
2120002837/I shall await you at the end of the beach, in an enchanting lagoon...
2120002838/He worships at the altar of the Lady of the Lake. Sometimes Dagon worshippers drive him away, but he always returns.
2120002839/The earth rune, a gift for a true warrior.
2120002840/A fisherman lives by the shore. He may lend you his boat.
2120002841/The book on vodyanoi contains knowledge on any fishpeople you encounter. The earth rune enhances your sword. Choose me and I will treat your wounds whenever you need.
2120002842/Terrible indeed! I lost my turquoise necklace as I swam in moonlight. A gift from the Lady of the Lake.
2120002843/How wonderful! I have no gold with which to pay, but perhaps some trinkets could prove useful.
2120002844/A naiad, a water nymph. I serve the Lady of the Lake.
2120002845/Splendid! Now your reward. I'll grant you a book on the vodyanoi, the earth rune, or I'll treat your wounds whenever you need...
2120002846/Trouble me not.
2120002847/They gather at night here on the shore. If you borrow a boat you may reach the island, where you'll find others. Some linger near the village.
2120002848/Of course, as we agreed.
2120002849/Let's talk.
2120002850/Take this token as a memento. The amulet will protect you from drowners.
2120002851/Once one of Vizima's most famous thieves, he moved as quietly as the wind. And quite handsome...
2120002852/Of course. Doubtless he stole my necklace. The drowners ever protect him...
2120002853/If not for my woes, I'd rejoice in a swim with you.
2120002854/He once escaped through the sewers, but his loot proved too heavy. He joined the drowned dead, but old habits rarely die as easily.
2120002855/Now stop!
2120002856/Madness...
2120002857/Strange...
2120002858/What terrible times.
2120002859/For me?
2120002860/Stop!
2120002861/Away with that.
2120002862/Just what we needed, rain.
2120002863/Come off it.
2120002864/It's damn wet.
2120002865/Accursed weather.
2120002866/Want something?
2120002867/Great trophy, I'd prefer the head of a racist bastard.
2120002868/What are you doing?!
2120002869/Heheheh...
2120002870/Riiight...
2120002871/Everyone's gone mad...
2120002872/Are you crazy? Stop!
2120002873/Whoa, what's that supposed to mean?
2120002874/God dam rain.
2120002875/Come off it.
2120002876/It's fucking wet everywhere.
2120002877/Argh, farkin' weather.
2120002878/I'm not sleeping. I'm working, really.
2120002879/Go to hell!
2120002880/Go away!
2120002881/Thanks. Take this. It's a recipe. I found it among their papers.
2120002882/I want to sleep.
2120002883/Please don't tell them I was sleeping. They'll beat me.
2120002884/If humans win, the world faces a torturous death.
2120002885/Ruuuuuuuun!
2120002886/Ah, to hell with it.
2120002887/Defend yourself, bum!
2120002888/Please, no!
2120002889/Come here.
2120002890/I dislike this place.
2120002891/Follow me, boys!
2120002892/Farkin' follow me!
2120002893/See that? He's dead, just don't know it yet.
2120002894/Fight, you oaf!
2120002895/Attack!
2120002896/No.
2120002897/Come here!
2120002898/Vort, bloede dh'oine!
2120002899/Damned if we return empty-handed!
2120002900/Yaevinn will punish us for not following orders!
2120002901/We're soldiers, dammit!
2120002902/Perhaps the witcher can manage it...
2120002903/Where is it?
2120002904/Old underwear in a bank...?
2120002905/What a pile of manure...
2120002906/I don't want to die!
2120002907/Salvage what you can and run!
2120002908/Don't kill me!
2120002909/Leave me be!
2120002910/Stay away!
2120002911/Why do they do this...?
2120002912/What are you doing?!
2120002913/Stop, at once!
2120002914/Mhm...
2120002915/Terrible times.
2120002916/The plague.
2120002917/You're not serious.
2120002918/Damnable rain.
2120002919/Just what we needed, rain.
2120002920/Come off it.
2120002921/What should I say?
2120002922/You want something?
2120002923/Huh?
2120002924/Nice specimen. Cut it up yourself?
2120002925/What are you doing?!
2120002926/Stop! Now! At once!
2120002927/Ah, terrible times.
2120002928/Not good.
2120002929/The plague.
2120002930/I don't want that.
2120002931/Goddam rain.
2120002932/I don't know what to say.
2120002933/It's fucking wet everywhere.
2120002934/Argh, fucking weather.
2120002935/Sure. We'll see if there's truth to the rumors about you.
2120002936/I play professionally, I'd say.
2120002937/Can't complain. I have a nice, slow job, as a bouncer.
2120002938/The guests settle things between themselves. It's a quiet place. Birds don't ever shit in their own nests.
2120002939/It's me, Munro... Exiles? The war? You, Zoltan and I helped them. You must remember.
2120002940/How are things, Geralt?
2120002941/Play Carmen in the brothel across the way. You might also practice with Zoltan.
2120002942/Even now.
2120002943/No offense, but I play professionals.
2120002944/I couldn't believe Zoltan when he said you'd returned.
2120002945/Geralt? It's been ages!
2120002946/Let me sleep...
2120002947/Mahakam - makes me retch.
2120002948/Don't say another word about Mahakam!
2120002949/Better than the Alderman's rule.
2120002950/I served under Barclay Els.
2120002951/We beat down those Nilfgaard arses!
2120002952/At Brenna - a fight to remember!
2120002953/Scars, glory and honor, that's what!
2120002954/I hear Vivaldi's bankrupt.
2120002955/Who'll run the gentry's books?
2120002956/Dealing with humans leads to ruin.
2120002957/Brugenhaff cheated at gwent again.
2120002958/One should tell bastards like that to go plow themselves!
2120002959/"You only have yourself to blame." I know.
2120002960/Well... tomorrow...
2120002961/Begone!
2120002962/What do you want?
2120002963/I rarely see witchers but still don't stare. Want to see my stock?
2120002964/Yes, he describes its history, too.
2120002965/Sadly, I don't have it. I've been trying for years to acquire the volume from Golan Vivaldi, but he's a stubborn dwarf.... You try. Perhaps he'll sell it to you.
2120002966/Hmm... A passage in Alvaro's 'The Secret Gates' focuses on magic towers.
2120002967/"Ain Soph Aur," an alchemy treatise by gnomes. Difficult to find, but a certain hermit in the swamp might know something...
2120002968/I just remembered another book about the tower.
2120002969/How do we assimilate with them if they don't assimilate with us?
2120002970/Shove off, lest me and the boys hurt ya.
2120002971/I spit on humans and their principles!
2120002972/Books, scrolls, parchments!
2120002973/Dwarven rabble pleads poverty, yet I pulled loads of gold teeth from their bodies!
2120002974/Others are looting. Why not me?
2120002975/Move or you'll be sorry!
2120002976/Now you've pissed me off.
2120002977/Damn, I'm hungry.
2120002978/Attack! Kill!
2120002979/Desist! I surrender!
2120002980/Run! Move!
2120002981/No closer, you bastard.
2120002982/What a dump.
2120002983/Follow me, boys!
2120002984/Fight! Damn these bastards!
2120002985/I'd have your balls if you had any.
2120002986/Kidding?
2120002987/I like this!
2120002988/I figured you're looking for a fight.
2120002989/Sorry. I'll gladly join you.
2120002990/You have a pig for a father.
2120002991/I don't play with scoundrels.
2120002992/I'd sooner be covered in boils than play cards with you cheats.
2120002993/True.
2120002994/What can I do, they're brothers in arms.
2120002995/They fight bravely and Yaevinn shows cleverness.
2120002996/Oop.
2120002997/Look at that freak.
2120002998/When I think of my kinsmen rotting in human towns, I feel like laughing.
2120002999/What?
2120003000/I'm off to thump somebody.
2120003001/I'm hungry.
2120003002/I could use a beer.
2120003003/Shove off.
2120003004/And I seek something to drink.
2120003005/That human-loving traitor? No help here.
2120003006/What gives?
2120003007/Oaaah. I'm sleepy.
2120003008/What?
2120003009/Ooo! Farted!
2120003010/Glad there're no magic locks...
2120003011/Just lift it up and...
2120003012/I used to crack a safe in 5 minutes...
2120003013/Don't think I'll recover.
2120003014/An elf shot me in the arse.
2120003015/I owe my life to Miss Shani.
2120003016/Melitele's milk, it hurts!
2120003017/We would've died if not for Miss Shani.
2120003018/The last slaughter yielded the same mess.
2120003019/Perhaps the danger has passed.
2120003020/The birds will feast tonight.
2120003021/When will we ever learn to live in peace?
2120003022/Enough, I don't have the strength.
2120003023/I have no home.
2120003024/I'd prefer to fight at the front, but Yaevinn designated me quartermaster.
2120003025/Can I interest you in something?
2120003026/Certainly, our rebellion requires coin as much as it requires steel. I mean no offense, Gwynbleidd. As Yaevinn says, you need gold to wage a war.
2120003027/Stop! Now!
2120003028/Not so bad...
2120003029/It'll work out...
2120003030/Shove it.
2120003031/What the hell's on your belt?
2120003032/Enough madness. Stop!
2120003033/Shove it up your arse.
2120003034/What brings you here?
2120003035/Huh?
2120003036/It's raining.
2120003037/I can't work.
2120003038/Stop raining.
2120003039/Rather wet.
2120003040/What are you doing?!
2120003041/Yaaa...
2120003042/Waste of words...
2120003043/Fuck it.
2120003044/Are you crazy? Stop!
2120003045/Wasting your time.
2120003046/It's raining.
2120003047/What a downpour.
2120003048/I can't go back to work.
2120003049/Care to stop dropping, you bastard?
2120003050/This lady tol' me to get out of her garden so I peed on her flowers to make 'em grow pretty, haha.
2120003051/A basilisk is dead and gone... It's clear you're best not messed with.
2120003052/Shove off, lest me and the boys hurt ya.
2120003053/If I were Vivaldi, I would do all I could to destroy this city.
2120003054/What do you seek here, human?
2120003055/Vivaldi, but I doubt he'll speak with you.
2120003056/Vivaldi detests humans and this city. Believe me, he has reason.
2120003057/The guards have been thick on the ground recently.
2120003058/I saw Foltest. Swear on my mother's life.
2120003059/Scram!
2120003060/Greetings, sir.
2120003061/I cannot. You don't come recommended and we only serve our own and friends...
2120003062/Whaddaya need?
2120003063/Indeed. I run the shop, keep things tidy. Whaddaya need?
2120003064/Mr. Chivay says you're right and honorable, so I see no reason not to trade. Here you are.
2120003065/You've pissed me off.
2120003066/Damn I'm hungry.
2120003067/Attack! Kill!
2120003068/Desist! I surrender!
2120003069/Run! Move your feet!
2120003070/Not a step closer, bastard.
2120003071/What a dump.
2120003072/Follow me, boys!
2120003073/Engage! Damn these bastards!
2120003074/I'd cut off your balls if you had any.
2120003075/Wasting my time.
2120003076/I love this!
2120003077/Death doesn't scare me. It's liberty or the grave.
2120003078/They call us Squirrels because of the plumes on our hats. We'll replace those with human scalps.
2120003079/What?
2120003080/That traitor on a human leash? You'll find no aid here. Picking herbs is beneath me anyhow.
2120003081/Dark thoughts haunt me at night. Come back tomorrow.
2120003082/I beg you, no!
2120003083/You forget so much...
2120003084/I miss...
2120003085/Humans are strange.
2120003086/How have I wronged you?
2120003087/Ha ha! Is that a joke in your land?
2120003088/Rain makes everything bloom...
2120003089/Rain cleanses.
2120003090/Who cries so in the clouds?
2120003091/This city could drown for all I care.
2120003092/Elves and dwarves living together! Runts spread filth like pigs.
2120003093/Quite unfair. The diseased end up in hospital, and nonhumans... in Old Vizima.
2120003094/My nation dies and there's naught I can do.
2120003095/Back where you belong!
2120003096/Racist! Poking fun or copping a feel?! Shove off!
2120003097/My mother sang sad elven lullabies...
2120003098/Will this world grow worse when we are gone?
2120003099/The forests here, though beautiful, only sadden me.
2120003100/Why fight any longer?
2120003101/In the era of humans, forget us not, dh'oine.
2120003102/Nothing for us here! Run!
2120003103/I'll scratch your eyes out!
2120003104/Hm.
2120003105/Rip out their throats!
2120003106/Fury!
2120003107/Hear the wolf pack?
2120003108/I don't wish to die! Please!
2120003109/Any further and your throat is meat.
2120003110/Get him!
2120003111/It's drizzling.
2120003112/What a downpour.
2120003113/Charge!
2120003114/When will this end?
2120003115/Go to hell.
2120003116/Fall back! Everyone hear? Retreat!
2120003117/I see now we shall be victorious...
2120003118/The elven star rises!
2120003119/You cannot do that! No!
2120003120/Free the elves!
2120003121/No further, understood?
2120003122/Halt!
2120003123/Follow me! The elven star rises!
2120003124/They consider us cruel, so be cruel.
2120003125/They showed us no mercy, so show them none.
2120003126/It's necessary...
2120003127/Wasting your time.
2120003128/Humans are intruders. We aim to win back our world.
2120003129/Then I shall tell you about green mould.
2120003130/Some of our greatest died combating humans. First, when your kind arrived in these lands, then recently, when we again concluded we couldn't abide mankind's tyranny.
2120003131/You reek, human.
2120003132/You do know feainnewedd. I thought wrongly about you.
2120003133/Why should I?
2120003134/You know as much as I, dh'oine.
2120003135/I can describe burmarigold.
2120003136/Look, then, at this fool's parsley...
2120003137/Wait... I've long carried this book I need no more. Read it, and you'll learn of what I speak, though I doubt you'll understand its message.
2120003138/You do know feainnewedd. I thought wrongly about you.
2120003139/Come back tomorrow.
2120003140/Show me. I sense it will be something amusing.
2120003141/Have you seen feainnewedd flowers? You couldn't find one because you can't distinguish it from common plants.
2120003142/What do you seek? You bother me.
2120003143/History repeats itself. But this time, we'll cut off more than your hand...
2120003144/Retreat! I repeat, retreat!
2120003145/Observe your own death!
2120003146/Idleness tires me.
2120003147/Get them! Show no mercy!
2120003148/Say hello to death!
2120003149/No!
2120003150/Your next step will be your last.
2120003151/Heard something.
2120003152/Everyone follow me! Follow me!
2120003153/Attack!
2120003154/Die!
2120003155/Why stay here and rot?
2120003156/Others might agree. I don't.
2120003157/We've won the battle but the war rages on. We are hunting stragglers from the Order, though I expect we'll form up for action again soon.
2120003158/Gwynbleidd! Quite pleased you survived!
2120003159/I'd rather take all of Temeria, but Yaevinn is cautious and cunning as a fox. Rumor has it he wishes to negotiate with Foltest.
2120003160/Only humans could create such abominations.
2120003161/Suffering ennobles you...
2120003162/Ethel an gleant var me.
2120003163/The knights lost much in the last battle and lack reinforcements. If we defeat White Rayla, Old Vizima is ours.
2120003164/We must retake the barricades from White Rayla...
2120003165/Kill the dh'oine!
2120003166/Freedom, I love and understand her, freedom I never will surrender...
2120003167/Treating humans, I see.
2120003168/Bloede dh'oine.
2120003169/We'll wait outside.
2120003170/We wound them so they'll die. And you're treating them? How illogical - and contrary to our interests.
2120003171/The dh'oine will long remember this day.
2120003172/You wanted war. So be it!
2120003173/Vizima burns, like our raging hearts.
2120003174/Fall back! Everyone hear? Retreat!
2120003175/I see now we shall be victorious...
2120003176/Kill them.
2120003177/The elven star rises!
2120003178/Don't! No!
2120003179/Free the elves!
2120003180/Halt!
2120003181/I'll lead.
2120003182/Your objective, to kill!
2120003183/I do not fear death!
2120003184/It's necessary...
2120003185/Wasting my time.
2120003186/It's a trap! They're attacking!
2120003187/You dare come here, dh'oinne?
2120003188/Some complained when we took their food, so they had to die. We may let the others live.
2120003189/We'll wait for our scouts to come back and return to the forest. The supplies we took from these peasants will last us for weeks.
2120003190/Greetings, Gwynbleidd.
2120003191/No, to support a just cause and prevent a massacre like that in the Outskirts. And to save your Alvin from the Order's bloodthirsty lackeys.
2120003192/Toruviel is a living symbol of our struggle! She has no right to turn and flee! You've done so much for us already, so stand with her, with the persecuted, against those who are blinded by hatred!
2120003193/I lead the reinforcements Yaevinn sent to help Toruviel. As you can see, Vivaldi's gold is finally serving a just cause.
2120003194/Unimportant. Toruviel could hardly run forever. The Order's hounds cannot be outrun. She should see this as an opportunity to face and defeat her persecutors, and then return to aid Yaevinn.
2120003195/Geralt of Rivia. Toruviel spoke of you...
2120003196/Delighting in the last moments of my life, or trying to. I hang tomorrow... I have a request.
2120003197/I've always found games pleasant and Jethro let me keep my dice. If you don't have your own set, we can share mine.
2120003198/Greetings, white one.
2120003199/Tomorrow's my big day.
2120003200/This entire world is engulfed in blood...
2120003201/I didn't see White Rayla among the knights.
2120003202/My wounds will heal, but to live without a soul...
2120003203/We won, but has our flight ended?
2120003204/Bloede dh'oine are eating dirt. We're free.
2120003205/We killed many deserving dh'oine!
2120003206/Beware, knights of the Order may yet hide among the ruins.
2120003207/The Order has been taught a lesson. Now we must set matters right.
2120003208/Yaevinn promised victory and we won!
2120003209/We won! Understand? We won!
2120003210/What have we done...?
2120003211/It was a slaughter...
2120003212/I shall not live to see the dawn.
2120003213/I die for freedom.
2120003214/Curse the Order of the Flaming Rose!
2120003215/Death to the Order!
2120003216/Taste the iron of my arrows!
2120003217/FREEEEDOOOM!!!
2120003218/Death to the dh'oine!
2120003219/Aerlinen!
2120003220/Yaevinn!
2120003221/I detest you, dh'oine!
2120003222/Hmm.
2120003223/Nothing can save you!
2120003224/Please no!
2120003225/Retreat immediately!
2120003226/Come to die?
2120003227/Follow me!
2120003228/Dog on a human leash.
2120003229/When I behold you, I wonder why they call us outcasts.
2120003230/I see tales of the witcher's deeds are true.
2120003231/Attack!
2120003232/I'll watch you die!
2120003233/At them!
2120003234/When will this end?
2120003235/Go to hell.
2120003236/I detest you, dh'oine!
2120003237/Hm.
2120003238/Fight! Stop them!
2120003239/I shall cut you, hairy ape!
2120003240/Please, no!
2120003241/Retreat at once!
2120003242/Are you here to die?
2120003243/Follow me!
2120003244/At him!
2120003245/You shall die, human!
2120003246/When will this end?
2120003247/Do humans find that amusing?
2120003248/Willing to die for that greedy dh'oinne? You're not one of them.
2120003249/We'll slay you and then Haren. As a lesson to all traitors. Spar'le!
2120003250/We'll be back soon, our whole unit.
2120003251/Good. We have no choice... But you do...
2120003252/Here. We'll take what we need now and come back for the rest later.
2120003253/Ceadmil, hav'caaren.
2120003254/N'aen dh'oinne, esse vatt'ghern! You'll not intimidate us, witcher. Where's Haren Brogg? He promised us some hawkers' specialties.
2120003255/Vart tel'naen. You're no Aen Seidhe, but you're not dh'oinne filth either. We'll just take our weapons and let's part in peace.
2120003256/We're no criminals, we'll pay you. We have gold, pelts, herbs...
2120003257/Va'fail vatt'ghern.
2120003258/Listen carefully, vatt'ghern. We're part of a twenty-elf unit. Our brothers suffer from disease and hunger. These crates contain food, medicine and weapons. We want them now, for we can't approach Vizima's walls every day.
2120003259/For freedom! Kill the dh'oine!
2120003260/I miss our homeland.
2120003261/Why must we fight alongside the dwarves?
2120003262/True. I sound like a human! When will the battle begin?
2120003263/I'd sooner die free than live as a dh'oine's slave.
2120003264/I love the scent of the morning swamp.
2120003265/That wind may disperse our remains.
2120003266/Humans are intruders. We aim to win back our world.
2120003267/A d'yaebl aep arse.
2120003268/Death frightens me not. Liberty or the grave!
2120003269/What do you seek?
2120003270/They name us Squirrels for the tails on our caps. We'll replace those with human scalps anon.
2120003271/I played the lute, but gave up my instrument for a sword.
2120003272/First we take Vizima, then the world.
2120003273/You stink, human.
2120003274/The dh'oine are dead. We should return.
2120003275/You lead.
2120003276/We fight alongside dwarves, but elves will lead the approaching war.
2120003277/Humans are intruders. We aim to win back our world.
2120003278/A d'yaebl aep arse.
2120003279/Death doesn't scare me. Liberty or the grave!
2120003280/What are you looking for?
2120003281/They call us Squirrels for the plumes on our hats. We'll replace those with human scalps.
2120003282/I played the lute, but gave up my instrument for a sword.
2120003283/First we take Vizima, then the world.
2120003284/You stink, human.
2120003285/What?
2120003286/That traitor on a human leash? I shan't help you. Picking roots is belittling anyway.
2120003287/What good is human magic? Tricks, nothing more. However, Yaevinn showed interest in that building.
2120003288/Come back tomorrow.
2120003289/Say something, human?
2120003290/We fight alongside dwarves, but elves will lead the approaching war.
2120003291/I played the lute, but gave up my instrument for a sword.
2120003292/First we take Vizima, then we take the world.
2120003293/Come back tomorrow.
2120003294/We fight alongside dwarves, but elves will lead the approaching war.
2120003295/Kill us and you'll never reach them in time. Aid them and we'll be free... Choose, mutant!
2120003296/Then visit the city. It's inhabited by a criminal race. We fight to survive. Humans only comprehend force and thus will we talk to them.
2120003297/What do you seek here, witcher?
2120003298/You threaten us, dh'oine, but know six ape-people, including women and children, remain inside the crypt... with the ghouls...
2120003299/Half the unit's disappeared! Cries came from that breach in the wall.
2120003300/I sense evil, friend, great evil.
2120003301/Aelireeen!!
2120003302/Sheraweeeed!!!
2120003303/Bloe'de Dh'oine!
2120003304/Find Yaevinn inside the vault in the bank's cellar.
2120003305/Wish to negotiate, dh'oine?
2120003306/Bloede d'hoinne!
2120003307/Everyone on the floor!
2120003308/No one move!!!
2120003309/This is a robbery!!!
2120003310/I'll skewer anyone who moves!
2120003311/Let 'em come!
2120003312/They're negotiating in the front.
2120003313/Glad there are no mages there.
2120003314/They're starting the attack.
2120003315/Why aren't they coming through the back?
2120003316/Is it true you wish to negotiate, dh'oine?
2120003317/Bloede dh'oine!
2120003318/Good you're here.
2120003319/Same as the rest. Eating berries and dreaming of my place on earth.
2120003320/Geralt? I'm not surprised to see you.
2120003321/Maybe I will, provided nothing drastic happens...
2120003322/You work hard, pay taxes, then come the pogroms. You flee as they torch your tavern.
2120003323/I've survived that. Humans prevented me from living as I wished to.
2120003324/I won't take charity. I once ran a tavern, I'd skin you.
2120003325/It's me, Chireadan. Recognize me?
2120003326/Apparently not. You were busy.
2120003327/Why not. Got nothing to lose.
2120003328/I'll get another business running.
2120003329/True, Geralt. And see what's come of it? A mess, not assimilation.
2120003330/Disdainful times. More bad luck around the corner.
2120003331/I suspect you let me win.
2120003332/No charity, please.
2120003333/A foresaw a different end.
2120003334/You can't escape from who you are.
2120003335/I'd like to believe that.
2120003336/Good luck.
2120003337/Caedmil Vaatghern.
2120003338/Do you have the giant centipede armor?
2120003339/The Lady of the Lake reigns in this land. We're safe here. Though I have heard of conflict with the vodyanoi.
2120003340/The goddess of this land. Listen to the bubbling waters, the whispering of the trees, look at the waving grains, the smiling people... you'll sense it, too.
2120003341/For 100 orens.
2120003342/Craftsmen produce useful items. The beauty of my works could awaken the dead...
2120003343/You'll understand when you meet her...
2120003344/It's ready. Do you have my payment?
2120003345/We escaped from Vizima. The wounded and sick lie in the cave. If you'd like, speak with our leader - Toruviel.
2120003346/When the chaos of war surrounds us, few care for beauty and harmony. I ensure that beauty remains in the world. I create customized objects...
2120003347/Yes?
2120003348/The legendary witchers' armor. It has unique magical qualities...
2120003349/It was made in the gnomes' workshops, but finished by elves. The songmaster Tyen'sail took an interest in Raven's armor and worked for twelve days straight, each movement of his chisel accompanied by a song of power.
2120003350/Legend says that in battle, the armor sang for Raven a song of victory, adding to his confidence and calming him...
2120003351/I would look in crypts if I were you. Find the tomb of the elven songmaster. Objects belonging to him in life must lie in or near his sarcophagus.
2120003352/I see.
2120003353/Finally, I'll be able to progress with my work... Take this pouch for your toil.
2120003354/In gratitude I shall betray to you our elven knowledge of herbs, White Wolf.
2120003355/Elves wander eternally...
2120003356/When will we enjoy a hearty meal?
2120003357/Fruit? You mock me, dh'oinne! Meat daily for you and I'm to die eating fruit?
2120003358/A juicy cut of meat! Thank you, Gwynn'bleidd.
2120003359/Go, dh'oine!
2120003360/I'd refuse were I not so hungry...
2120003361/When will we stop fleeing?
2120003362/Thank you, Gwynn'bleidd.
2120003363/Nice gesture, but you consider this satiating? Fruit increases the appettite. Meat is what I need to live.
2120003364/I'm returning to the Blue Mountains.
2120003365/I feel death approaching...
2120003366/I can go no further.
2120003367/We must now accept charity from dh'oinne...
2120003368/In exchange I shall tell you about mandrake root and han fibre, both valuable herbs.
2120003369/I haven't the strength to hunt.
2120003370/Why would I need this?
2120003371/The enemy! Attack!
2120003372/You're funny.
2120003373/Lara Dorren!
2120003374/I don't want to die! Please!
2120003375/Retreat! Fall back!
2120003376/You move like a fly in molasses!
2120003377/Morvudd! Stop!
2120003378/Follow me!
2120003379/Attack!
2120003380/Go to hell.
2120003381/I refuse.
2120003382/Disengage! Fall back!
2120003383/For the Valley of Flowers!
2120003384/Lara Dorren!
2120003385/I don't want to die! Please!
2120003386/Yaevinn!
2120003387/Morvudd! Stop!
2120003388/Draw your weapons! Attack!
2120003389/Charge!
2120003390/The enemy! Kill them!
2120003391/Go to hell.
2120003392/Soon the world will be our homeland.
2120003393/Be patient. They'll prove useful in battle.
2120003394/Only Yaevinn knows. Until then, practice. What you learn may save your life.
2120003395/True.
2120003396/An easterly wind - hope of a better future.
2120003397/Unless we're trapped in the swamp.
2120003398/A d'yaebl aep arse.
2120003399/What good is human magic? Tricks, nothing more. However, Yaevinn showed interest in that building.
2120003400/Come back tomorrow.
2120003401/Say something?
2120003402/Be good enough to leave me in peace.
2120003403/Only the path of revenge remains to us.
2120003404/I dislike such death.
2120003405/Was that our last battle?
2120003406/Why has Toruviel deserted us?
2120003407/I weep for the fallen.
2120003408/I'm afraid we might not leave this town alive...
2120003409/We'll die with dignity, spitting in the face of humans.
2120003410/Better to die than live in disgrace.
2120003411/Humans into the sea! Go back where you came from!
2120003412/I think all the hostages should be killed. They're rotten dh'oine!
2120003413/I'm ready to fight.
2120003414/Take no pity on them.
2120003415/Death everywhere.
2120003416/Will this never end?
2120003417/Curse you, humans!
2120003418/My children... Where are my children?
2120003419/Have you seen my husband?
2120003420/My life's work is burning.
2120003421/Remove those swords from my sight.
2120003422/Youths crippled by war will wander the world.
2120003423/Elves and humans - we never learn from our errors.
2120003424/I stitch up the victims of another's delusions and ambitions. Behold the evil those fools who govern have caused.
2120003425/I require herbs - can you find honeysuckle or wild hops?
2120003426/Thank you, dh'oine.
2120003427/Witchers collect monster stories, don't they? I heard one recently about ifrits. Listen...
2120003428/The medicine's finished. Oh, for a vial of White Raffard's Decoction!
2120003429/Aaaaaaaaggghhh!
2120003430/Death and horror!
2120003431/None shall escape the city alive!
2120003432/Why have the gods punished me?!
2120003433/The city burns... We are lost.
2120003434/Who will help us?
2120003435/Perhaps... we were wrong?
2120003436/No mercy!
2120003437/Attack!
2120003438/Move back!
2120003439/Freedom!
2120003440/Your next step will be your last.
2120003441/All is lost...
2120003442/Attack!
2120003443/Stay close!
2120003444/Elaine deireadh!
2120003445/Our end approaches...
2120003446/You annoy me, human.
2120003447/Idleness tires me.
2120003448/No!
2120003449/We're backing out!
2120003450/For freedom!
2120003451/Stay away if you value your life.
2120003452/I cannot wait to fight.
2120003453/Stay close to me!
2120003454/Elder blood! Elder blood!
2120003455/Kill him.
2120003456/Kill them! They deserve death!
2120003457/Why stay and rot here?
2120003458/Elaine deireadh!
2120003459/What do you mean, human?
2120003460/Retreat! I repeat, retreat!
2120003461/Get them! Show no mercy!
2120003462/Attack!
2120003463/No!
2120003464/For freedom!
2120003465/Stay away if you value your life.
2120003466/Everyone follow me! Follow me!
2120003467/Attack!
2120003468/I wish to be elsewhere...
2120003469/Elaine deireadh!
2120003470/No, human.
2120003471/I thank you for the rescue, vatt'ghern.
2120003472/I don't wish to speak of it. N'te dice'en... tearde. I know your language, but not well enough to... Please visit me at home, later...
2120003473/Va fail.
2120003474/Learning requires time. A young mind can master our language in a few years, but learning palestras...
2120003475/Concentrate.
2120003476/If true, perhaps you won't need to learn it anew. I'll speak in elven. Maybe you'll understand.
2120003477/Vatt'ghern!
2120003478/A'baeth.
2120003479/En'ca minne... A'baeth me Gwynbleidd.
2120003480/Me Caeme ys Aevon y Pont ar Gwennelen.
2120003481/That means... how do you say...?
2120003482/That means "beautiful."
2120003483/You're quite the apt pupil.
2120003484/Va fail.
2120003485/May we meet in better times. Va fail Gwynbleidd...
2120003486/Ceadmil vatt'ghern.
2120003487/Pity, White Wolf. Your language is like a stone axe, ours like a beautiful viroledans sword, light in the hand as you perform palestras and crescent moon parries...
2120003488/Que?
2120003489/Vort!
2120003490/Essea Feainnewedd.
2120003491/Feaine means sun, wedd - child.
2120003492/This place lacks the beauty that normally surrounds my people.
2120003493/Beware if you intend to stay - fanatics hunt nonhumans at night.
2120003494/Back where you belong!
2120003495/You cannot imagine what you've done! The diviner's curse spares no one.
2120003496/Stop it. I beg you to stop! Help!
2120003497/I'll soon fade like stars when dawn comes.
2120003498/I don't need your pity.
2120003499/Caed'mill, Gwynnbleid.
2120003500/Help?! No, you want to demonstrate superiority by throwing food at me as if I were wild! Cease your patronizing, human!
2120003501/You speak of anger?! You... I would beat you so hard you'll remember me! You...
2120003502/So you've come to laugh, to marvel at freaks.
2120003503/I'm tired of fleeing.
2120003504/I spit on your charity!
2120003505/What's that?
2120003506/Begone, dh'oine!
2120003507/I'm so hungry...
2120003508/We just roasted a knight of the Order in his armor.
2120003509/I hear Yaevinn and Foltest are making a deal. I hope not.
2120003510/We can now live as we please.
2120003511/Let everything burn. Down to the foundations.
2120003512/I never thought so many would perish or that the city would burn...
2120003513/A healthy rain would improve matters.
2120003514/Push the humans into the sea!
2120003515/Beware the dogs of the Order!
2120003516/Move on! Death to the humans!
2120003517/May the human city burn!
2120003518/Fear not! Yaevinn leads us!
2120003519/I'm pleased you joined our fight!
2120003520/Flee!
2120003521/I detest the dh'oine!
2120003522/Attack! Stop them!
2120003523/Freeeeeedom!
2120003524/Please, no!
2120003525/Stand where you are!
2120003526/I'm tired...
2120003527/At him!
2120003528/Charge!
2120003529/No doubts...
2120003530/Go to hell.
2120003531/Yaevinn!
2120003532/Don't kill me! I want to live!
2120003533/Help!
2120003534/Dh'oine...
2120003535/Stinking apes...
2120003536/It was a good life.
2120003537/Approach, white-hair.
2120003538/Don't assume we'll shower you in gold just for killing a monster!
2120003539/Hey... come here, witcher...
2120003540/Humans are lice.
2120003541/I wonder how long they'll fend off the ghouls.
2120003542/Choose! Take our lives or save your precious humans!
2120003543/So, show us the worth of human lives!
2120003544/Humans should perish!
2120003545/Humans know not how to die with dignity.
2120003546/Let's see your "humanity." Fight us instead of saving the helpless!
2120003547/You saw that... evil in there! Our comrades are dead! Let's leave!
2120003548/I'll take punishment over whatever lies beyond.
2120003549/We should perform our duty, but against earthly enemies...
2120003550/We can take it.
2120003551/Complications...
2120003552/Where did those kikimores come from?
2120003553/Maybe we should negotiate?
2120003554/Perhaps we can break through...
2120003555/Ever fought a frightener?
2120003556/What can we do?
2120003557/That is one huge mantis, though.
2120003558/Sorry, I know you've fought bandits and mages before.... Uhh... Remember your potions.
2120003559/Bandits are a rare form of entertainment.
2120003560/I'm not about to go quietly.
2120003561/Beware of the Professor. I've heard he's a professional, ended 17 lives.
2120003562/Not bad, but you need to practice.
2120003563/Maybe... It's a little more complicated than that. See, we've never shown her the lab, and the last mutation was completed years ago, before the battle. Vesemir can tell you more.
2120003564/Have you spoken to Lambert about combat?
2120003565/It's a three-stage process. The first is the Choice. Leo completed it, enduring the hard training and diet.
2120003566/In exchange, we see in the dark, heal much faster than ordinary folk, and gain increased resistance to poison.
2120003567/I don't know the specifics... It involves changes like the mutation of the eyes, the bone marrow, hormones...
2120003568/Unfortunately not. The liver and heart often fail, the mind sometimes too, resulting in excessive aggression...
2120003569/Special mushrooms, mosses and herbs are grown in the lab. Combined with training, they accelerate muscle growth and digestion, improving the body's general condition.
2120003570/An incomparable inventor, like most of his race. Through years of research, he discovered an amazing substance.
2120003571/What is it?
2120003572/Need anything, Wolf?
2120003573/The Trial of the Grasses. More idiotic tales have been conjured up about that than about princesses and dwarves...
2120003574/Here.
2120003575/You gotta be kidding. There's some on the floor.
2120003576/Before the raid, the lab contained vials, hearths, formulae, herbs, and the Grasses. A mage and his magic were all that was lacking.
2120003577/Others quickly realized that a substance designed to rip granite from the ground could destroy castle walls. Some even considered using it in open battle.
2120003578/Not bad. You seem to be in good shape.
2120003579/Usually less of them gather, and their cries rarely sound so desperate... When the storm came, I gave up the hunt and headed toward Kaer Morhen. Met the others on the way.
2120003580/Yes. I was out hunting. Just before the storm came, a swarm of nightjars took flight. Hundreds of them. Gray streaks across the sky, trilling wildly.
2120003581/He intended it for use in mines and quarries. Though a genius, Alfred failed to foresee his invention's possible applications.
2120003582/Triss would like to use our secrets to heal people and such. I've no doubt she'd try, but it's never that simple.
2120003583/Though Vesemir plays up the importance of potions, he's hardly an expert. After all, he's always taught swordplay.
2120003584/She respects our secrets, and she's done a lot for us, for you... I trust her.
2120003585/Ever heard of the gnome Alfred Nabel?
2120003586/The Grasses affect the nervous system, so magic must control the process. The Trial results in lightning fast reflexes, reaction times normal people will never attain. Only four out of ten survive.
2120003587/Just one... our own. I thought I was going to lose it when your hair turned white.
2120003588/Mages stopped it from spreading. Alfred committed suicide and his lab burned down.
2120003589/How can I help?
2120003590/Entirely.
2120003591/Well, I've always prefered an armory to a lab.
2120003592/Still, he tries to teach us everything he learned when he was young, and that was a while back. But to be honest, I don't care for all these powders, mushrooms and other trash.
2120003593/Alcohol. The better it is, the purer and more powerful your potion.
2120003594/He's quick to use his sword and has quite a bit to say about it. But that's not always the best tactic. Let me show you some hand-to-hand techniques.
2120003595/We're infertile.
2120003596/Geralt's right. We need to protect the lab and kill the frightener. Who goes where?
2120003597/You can't fight for us all. I'm going with you.
2120003598/Triss may be right. We need to find out what they want.
2120003599/You'll regret that!
2120003600/Halt!
2120003601/Die!
2120003602/Geralt, no time to lose!
2120003603/Get moving, Geralt.
2120003604/You asked for it!
2120003605/Forget it.
2120003606/Everything's all right. I've no idea where you've been. The important thing is you're alive and among friends. Though you look like you just left your grave.
2120003607/We'll speak soon enough. We're nearing Kaer Morhen.
2120003608/We're home.
2120003609/Leo, get Triss.
2120003610/They won't get anywhere without a battering ra...
2120003611/I'll go west. I know a few people there and I prefer the coastal climate.
2120003612/I dare you.
2120003613/Ha! I'll smash yer face.
2120003614/I've had enough!
2120003615/Fight like a man.
2120003616/Stay!
2120003617/Watching or fighting?
2120003618/Your mama loves dwarves.
2120003619/I ache to fight.
2120003620/Who's next?
2120003621/No challenge?
2120003622/Enough!
2120003623/No.
2120003624/If you desire to go to Vizima, talk to my chamberlain. I shall be away from the castle for some time... See Velerad about any other needs.
2120003625/Witcher...
2120003626/As I'm sure you surmised, I have not summoned you here out of whim. A serious matter weighs upon us. A curse binds my daughter. I want you to remove it.
2120003627/Witcher, imagine returning home from an excursion against a monster, a kikimore for instance, only to discover your home a... whorehouse.
2120003628/Consult them and think upon this matter. We shall speak about it again soon.
2120003629/Witcher of Rivia.
2120003630/I have gathered all who might offer aid. De Wett has been the princess' adjutant for the past half year. Velerad has known Adda since her childhood. And Triss Merigold is here for her extensive knowledge of magic and female intuition.
2120003631/I shall detain you no longer. Talk to my chamberlain about transport to Vizima.
2120003632/Truly? Dandelion is your friend yet you treat him altogether differently... No matter, I trust she poses no threat to Temeria's interests.
2120003633/Good.
2120003634/One last matter, witcher. Forgive me, but I had you followed... I received a report about your... personal life.
2120003635/You must know I hardly did this out of lewd curiosity. I'd like to know why you sought Shani's participation in recent events. What is that little medic's role in this melee?
2120003636/To your credit, Velerad said you thinned their ranks considerably. I trust you shall finish the matter?
2120003637/My daughter dealt with them, stupid girl. I regret I ever departed...
2120003638/What would that be, witcher?
2120003639/Yes, the famed neutrality. Alas, that is a luxury I cannot afford. Both sides chose my city as a battleground. Both will be duly punished.
2120003640/Silence, witcher, before you say too much. Rulers don't enjoy being refused more than once.
2120003641/You could start by being more enthusiastic about aiding a king. You could offer to slay whomever I choose?
2120003642/No need to be rude, witcher. I too loved Adda's mother...
2120003643/Friendship cannot exist between man and woman. Triss is beautiful, but remember that she is a sorceress. Ensure that she never entangles you in her intrigues.
2120003644/Ha! I knew it from the start. My spies have much to learn. I suspected it was only sex. Enjoy, Geralt.
2120003645/I must attend to other matters now.
2120003646/My servant will summon you when I have more time.
2120003647/They forbade me from marrying her... but I hope you fare better. At least as a mutant you need not worry about pregnancy.
2120003648/And perhaps I should behead the Grand Master and his underlings? That would solve the problem. Hm. Sadly, it's not that simple.
2120003649/Perhaps. We'll send Velerad to negotiate. His elven features may prevent them from shooting... But I jest. Restoring order requires more.
2120003650/Unfortunately, the knights have forgotten their place. They've developed a taste for power and want more. That is not something I can allow.
2120003651/The fires and the slain are their doing. You cannot deny that. But in truth... I need peace in my kingdom now.
2120003652/I'm not finished! Those you left in charge failed you. A traitor threatens to oust you from the home of your ancestors! Wouldn't you be angered? Would you not elect to shed more blood?
2120003653/In the meantime, equally urgent issues demand our attention.
2120003654/I must attend to some urgent matters. Speak with these excellent minds, gain their insight. And don't forget my daughter, witcher. I'm counting on you.
2120003655/No need for titles. Speak freely. You've had time to think. What's the prognosis on removing the curse from my daughter?
2120003656/Could the curse have returned... by itself?
2120003657/Should you succeed, would... hmmm... would Adda's mind be that of a child?
2120003658/You don't believe so...? You're not making this any easier... Geralt, do what you can to remove the curse. Failing that, you may slay her, without fear of retribution from me. When I last gave you my trust, you did not disappoint me.
2120003659/Don't thank me yet. Should you learn who cast the curse, tell me and only me.
2120003660/If you succeed, I'll grant your every wish, within reason of course. If you must slay her, do it quickly, cleanly. If you fail... and my daughter suffers, those dear to you will suffer, too.
2120003661/One more thing, witcher...
2120003662/This is... uh... confidential, so you must pledge these words will not venture beyond these walls.
2120003663/My spies tell me you play poker...
2120003664/And, well, I have trouble finding worthy opponents at court...
2120003665/They fear I would have their heads if I lost...
2120003666/Care to play?
2120003667/You must know I hardly did this out of lewd curiosity. My spies report that you are romancing Merigold. I need to know if there is anything more to it.
2120003668/The bastard. If I could get my hands on him...
2120003669/You're getting it, but only if those long-eared bastards stop burning my city and slaying my merchants. Did you hear that, Yaevinn?
2120003670/Witcher...
2120003671/I do not wish to speak of it. I'm not vengeful, so you needn't fear any unpleasantness from me. But never mention her name to me again.
2120003672/Much better than she was as a striga, yet she won't be herself again for some time. Witcher... How can I thank you?
2120003673/Welcome, witcher.
2120003674/Yes?
2120003675/Very interested. That makes the Grand Master, him alone, the enemy. Is that clear?
2120003676/Yes, I suppose the boy's right. But you shall take home 8000.
2120003677/This is no time to talk. We must act.
2120003678/And the Order need not be a foe. Led by someone sensible, it could be a friend to the people, it could be loyal to the king... Hear that, Siegfried?
2120003679/I don't want any fraternal assistance. Somehow the phrase evokes images of burnt villages and orphaned children roaming the countryside... This land has suffered enough. You're to smash the Order and return home.
2120003680/Only those that lay down their arms. And... not all can be forgiven, the people would not understand... Yaevinn, you must disappear. Go away, somewhere far. I shall restrain my officers from hunting you for a few days...
2120003681/And with that of your esteemed female friends? Indeed, you may. But don't forget, Merigold, I rule this bordello. Don't turn into Philippa, you're too pretty for that.
2120003682/I knew you could be trusted. After your official investiture, visit me at the palace. We have much to discuss... Grand Master.
2120003683/What do you mean?
2120003684/Don't get excited, Radovid, I've taken the brunt of the loss. Now, one thing at a time. You shall receive the three hamlets we spoke of, the witcher will kill De Aldersberg...
2120003685/Very interested. And that means the Order is the enemy. Is that clear?
2120003686/Very interested. The son of a bitch is attacking me with steel, poison and magic...
2120003687/Stop deliberating, son. We need to put out the fire in this whorehouse. We'll renegotiate customs duties later. Now, we must take action! Nothing doing with the marriage, but believe me, that pains me more than it does you.
2120003688/Stop deliberating, son. We need to put out the fire in this whorehouse. You'll get the princess' hand, and if life has taught me anything, half the kingdom as soon as I'm gone. As for De Aldersberg, we need to be rid of him. The witcher will slay him.
2120003689/So, let's talk politics, and don't you dare mention neutrality. Judging by your company, you're already involved, possibly up to your nose.
2120003690/I see our sweet sorceress has already begun indoctrinating you.
2120003691/Witcher, I wish to know who was behind all this.
2120003692/Isn't that a bit much?
2120003693/Yes, that's something I can promise.
2120003694/So we're all agreed. Radovid, your armies must subdue the Order in Redania and in the north of my lands.
2120003695/I don't want any fucking fraternal assistance. The phrase rubs me the wrong way... You are to smash the knights of the Order and withdraw.
2120003696/How so?
2120003697/To the average pleb in the street, the Order is fighting my armies. But make no mistake, this is a confrontation between me and the Grand Master. That ambitious fanatic...
2120003698/Don't overdo it! I'm a fucking king and I deserve some respect! Three villages for you, my would-be son-in-law, and 8000 orens to the witcher.
2120003699/One more thing, witcher.
2120003700/I'm glad to hear it. Now go. Vizima is burning, fighting rages, you won't have an easy time of it.
2120003701/Fine, another 200 gryvnas payable in two year's time...
2120003702/I can exempt your merchants from paying for storage along the Vizima-Tretogor route.
2120003703/I shall confiscate the Order's assets!
2120003704/I shall forgive you all your affronts...
2120003705/Eighteen months...
2120003706/Raise the hearth and poll taxes by three pence?! Are you out of your mind?
2120003707/I'm surrounded by imbeciles.
2120003708/Witcher...
2120003709/I cannot fathom why you carry that carcass.
2120003710/Geralt of Rivia...
2120003711/I rule a land of idiots.
2120003712/Hmm... No, better not...
2120003713/I've seen enough. Velerad, back to the castle.
2120003714/You should know kings are never late, Jacques.
2120003715/Nonsense, Velerad. This is my city, the capital of my kingdom. Dammit, I rule this land and I refuse to creep around its corners!
2120003716/What is he doing here?
2120003717/He'll come with us. I have a matter to discuss with him.
2120003718/Never! Over my dead body!
2120003719/Silence! You know you might as well wipe your arse with those intelligence reports. I want to see it with my own eyes.
2120003720/What do you propose?
2120003721/NOT_USED
2120003722/NOT_USED
2120003723/For your toil, a worthy pouch of gold.
2120003724/Temeria and Redania are allies. Thanks in no small part to you.
2120003725/NOT_USED
2120003726/NOT_USED
2120003727/Lords, protect me!
2120003728/Baa baa?
2120003729/Baa.
2120003730/Baa baa...
2120003731/Baa baa.
2120003732/Noooo!
2120003733/Out of my sight.
2120003734/Blessed waters!
2120003735/Oh blessed downpour!
2120003736/Baa baa baa!!!
2120003737/Baa baa! Rain!
2120003738/Oh, baa baa.
2120003739/Help! Murderer!
2120003740/Lords, grant me patience.
2120003741/I'm wasting time here.
2120003742/I'm gonna hang myself.
2120003743/Murderer! Stop the murderer!
2120003744/I'm gonna hang myself.
2120003745/Rain. Great.
2120003746/Wonderful, it's raining.
2120003747/Strange, I didn't think it was going to rain.
2120003748/A wall of rain.
2120003749/I'm a fool! I just had to see the swamp!
2120003750/What shall I do? Who will help me?
2120003751/Help!
2120003752/Hm.
2120003753/What was that?
2120003754/Nothing to do.
2120003755/Noooo!
2120003756/Forget it.
2120003757/Finally, rain!
2120003758/Wonderful downpour! Wonderful!
2120003759/This I like!
2120003760/It's so good it's raining!
2120003761/Ba ba ba!
2120003762/Ba ba ba, lumberjacks sticks to whea they logs. Whea else 'ould they sticks?

2120003765/Yuh, f'ya go straight west and then south by the hut, you sure reach the mage's tower. Ba ba ba...
2120003766/Damned buzzin' bloodsuckers, thea's more e'ery year. You'll fin' tha most by the tower.
2120003767/Ba ba ba... The swamp's wide and deep with mosquitoes up you arse. Ooh, they been stinging lately...
2120003768/Livin' here we gots druid'uns, brick-a-makers, lumberjacks, monsters.... And mosquitoes - that's who. Ba ba ba!
2120003769/Shouldsa say tha' from the start. Ba ba ba... 'South o' tha brick-a-makers' village. Best follow tha' path, past the 'orrid cave 'til you see stumps.
2120003770/That the furthes' nook i' the forest, with bee-you-teeful trees and wild beasts sittin' with druid'uns. Thatull be straight sou' west, but yous needs to pass the loggers or take 'nother path, hard to say wha...Ba ba ba!
2120003771/But i's shut and thea's nothing but blasted mosquitoes and some gelomes thea. Ba ba ba...
2120003772/F'ya need 'elp getsin somewheres you come to the right place. See, I's never gets lost... Ba ba ba!
2120003773/Else we's got mosquitoes. Ba ba ba...
2120003774/Ba ba ba... What you want to hear about?
2120003775/Naught now. But when I's six a brick fell on me 'ead. I's playing a game where you tossed a brick i' the air, counted five and ran so's the brick 'ouldn't bop ya'. Ne'er was good at counting... They says the brick made me stupi'. Ba ba ba!
2120003776/Ba ba... Greetin', m'lord, greetin'...
2120003777/Ba ba ba... We's got mo'sters amany - will-o'-wisps and mamons tha' keep a decent brick-a-maker from getting 'ome when he's a bits tipsy. We's got windwraiths and brownies wi' thea little red caps...
2120003778/We'll starve if we cannot work.
2120003779/Only faith can save us.
2120003780/I'll make sure in future.
2120003781/You seen the missis?
2120003782/The pots are empty, the brats wailing and the stove's cold.
2120003783/It circled the house, then fled at dawn.
2120003784/It crept from the swamp right to our door last night.
2120003785/It has no name.
2120003786/Those strays from the Dry Lands are the cause.
2120003787/The Lords are showing their dissatisfaction.
2120003788/Bad omen.
2120003789/The unjust will vanish in the depths.
2120003790/So Tradition claims.
2120003791/Gu'aelle vinaal o'elloth.
2120003792/A deluge will cover the world.
2120003793/Indeed, the Night of Appeasement approaches.
2120003794/Let us await the configuration of stars.
2120003795/Allabha oeg'ollugh.
2120003796/We live to believe. We believe to live eternally.
2120003797/Recently, we celebrated the birth of triplets, a good omen.
2120003798/To show thanks you can worship the Water Lords with us.
2120003799/He has a hut, but God knows where.
2120003800/Strangers rarely aid us. I'm surprised and touched.
2120003801/Beware your new friends from the Order. The Flaming Rose despises all difference.
2120003802/Is your hair white from the sun?
2120003803/Vizima grows and requires bricks.
2120003804/More elves in the area. I fear they plan some ill.
2120003805/Be wary of your new friends. Elves are treacherous human haters!
2120003806/Some treacherous, unscrupulous woodcutters live nearby. They're led by a dwarf.
2120003807/I hate droughts.
2120003808/Perhaps you'd settle down here? We could use a warrior for protection.
2120003809/My father and grandfather baked bricks. No doubt I will too.
2120003810/Perhaps he ran away, lured by the dry, evil world to escape. Like my brother years ago.
2120003811/I know the plant. It usually grows in water, so search in water-filled ditches.
2120003812/Yes?
2120003813/No one, but Gramps may remember something.
2120003814/Hmm?
2120003815/Guangharra bl'eagg, brother. Bless your waters.
2120003816/It stands in the swamp like always...
2120003817/Really?
2120003818/I'm glad we can't produce bricks.
2120003819/Ghuna Khallal mo'khaad!
2120003820/Who stands above the Lords?
2120003821/Blessed be the waters that created us.
2120003822/Water Lords, I summon ye!
2120003823/May the dry lands be cursed!
2120003824/Tell me about the waters of your fatherland.
2120003825/Haghal malkug ghe'lagh!
2120003826/We know you led knights of the Order against nonhumans. Elves came inquiring, but we said nothing.
2120003827/Begone, blasphemer!
2120003828/I liked the missing boy. Thank you for searching.
2120003829/My faith in the Lords is strong and I said nothing, even under torture. No one in the village spoke a word.
2120003830/May what is above remain closed else the gateway to the abyss opens.
2120003831/They asked if you're spying for the Order or paid from the royal coffer. They said they'd torch the village if we didn't inform them of your actions.
2120003832/Vaska sent the nonhumans away. The Water Lords teach us betrayal is a great evil and one shouldn't give in to such wickedness.
2120003833/The woodcutters abandoned their clearing. They couldn't stave off the monsters and the Salamanders' arrival was too much.
2120003834/They wished to know your intentions and how long you'd worked with nonhumans. They promised gold, but gold is meaningless when a man's fate is at stake.
2120003835/I understand and shall remain silent.
2120003836/May the Water Lords lead you along straight paths.
2120003837/Ghua'llac?
2120003838/Speak up.
2120003839/I know those flowers. The gods welcome offerings of beggartick and reward us.
2120003840/Hmm?
2120003841/Perhaps he ran away, lured by the dry, evil world to escape. Like my brother years ago.
2120003842/I knew you'd refuse - forgive me for the test. Here is true proof of my gratitude.
2120003843/It has been said: He shall refuse gifts for greater reward.
2120003844/It has been said the proud will fall and be covered in ash.
2120003845/I give this recipe hoping you'll use it to find a wife and settle among us, praising the Water Lords.
2120003846/A gift is a blessing from the giver. Take this coin as a blessing from me.
2120003847/The Lords say gratitude leads to the kingdom of the deep. Accept 100 orens as proof of my gratitude?
2120003848/From generation to generation, my family has passed down this recipe for a miraculous perfume that no woman can resist. It is my greatest treasure, so do not treat it lightly. With this, I won over my wife, as my father and grandfather did so with their brides.
2120003849/They threatened us. They wanted to know your intentions.
2120003850/You have powerful enemies, witcher. Scouts from the Order inquired about you.
2120003851/Yaevinn's Scoia'tael have come to detest you. First nonhumans, then bandits came around asking questions.
2120003852/Bandits came inquiring about you. Their sign a flaming lizard.
2120003853/We know you led elves against knights of the Order. Fear not, we shall not tell.
2120003854/The day is nigh when we shall sit by the Water Lords.
2120003855/May your roads be straight!
2120003856/Recently, we celebrated the birth of triplets, a good omen.
2120003857/He has a hut, but God knows where.
2120003858/Is your hair white from the sun?
2120003859/Vizima grows and requires bricks.
2120003860/More elves in the area. I fear they plan some ill.
2120003861/Some treacherous, unscrupulous woodcutters live nearby. They're led by a dwarf.
2120003862/I hate droughts.
2120003863/Perhaps you'd settle down here? We could use a warrior for protection.
2120003864/My father and grandfather baked bricks. No doubt I will too.
2120003865/Perhaps he ran away, lured by the dry, evil world to escape. Like my brother years ago.
2120003866/That plant grows in the swamp.
2120003867/Really?
2120003868/No one, but Gramps may remember something.
2120003869/Hmm?
2120003870/It stands in the swamp like always...
2120003871/Yes?
2120003872/Verily, I'm glad we can't produce bricks.
2120003873/I'll take you with one hand, bastard! Take that!
2120003874/Out! Or I'll kick you out!
2120003875/Shove off!
2120003876/That inflated singer seduced my daughter! OUT!
2120003877/Damn you, pass then! Just don't beat me anymore.
2120003878/Leave my daughter in peace!
2120003879/I don't believe you! Get out of my house, you blooming drifter!
2120003880/Shove off!
2120003881/Never let me see you again!
2120003882/It's compensation for pain and suffering.
2120003883/The lute is in a trunk upstairs.
2120003884/We are free!
2120003885/Please go. If they see us together, they'll beat me again...
2120003886/They're based at the former nonhumans' camp. You'd need an army to drive them out.
2120003887/Thanks be to the Lords!
2120003888/We wish to reward you.
2120003889/I dare not speak.
2120003890/Just in time!
2120003891/May you never suffer drought!
2120003892/They forced us to gather herbs, make fisstech. One group hides in the cave near the old logging area.
2120003893/If not for you, they'd have killed us.
2120003894/We are saved! At last!
2120003895/I cannot speak.
2120003896/They held us at a camp. One group may be by the old logging area.
2120003897/Thanks be to the Lords and to you.
2120003898/Hear that, everyone? We're going home.
2120003899/Hiccup!
2120003900/What do you want?
2120003901/Let's celebrate!
2120003902/Have a drink with me!
2120003903/You alr'dy won. Now we drink for pleasure.
2120003904/Strong head you have there.
2120003905/Drank with a merchant recently. Weak-headed, he was. Take his book.
2120003906/S'all the same. The Beast'll have us all.
2120003907/Hiccup!
2120003908/Let's drink before we die.
2120003909/Doooown the hatch.
2120003910/Oooh... that's strong stuff.
2120003911/Hey, daaarlin'... hic-cup... ooo, my apologies.
2120003912/Here's to the ladies...
2120003913/Those are nice things.
2120003914/Stop!
2120003915/What's that?
2120003916/Drat.
2120003917/Help!
2120003918/We're getting angry.
2120003919/Weather's gone sour.
2120003920/It's raining again.
2120003921/I can't stand rain.
2120003922/Damn., Shit.
2120003923/Had a terrible nightmare. I dreamt of a sunken city and a god lying on the lake bottom.
2120003924/The grumbling fishermen refused to take me to Black Tern Island.
2120003925/I hope those elves leave the lakeside.
2120003926/I say unto all: harmony with the fishpeople is the best solution.
2120003927/She just loves carrots.
2120003928/Spare my life, master elf. I've done your kind no harm!
2120003929/Murky Waters! Now that's a beautiful village!
2120003930/Keep your hands off our women.
2120003931/I must sell my cow, but Vizima's gates remain closed.
2120003932/Crushed garlic and hemlock drive off the Beast's creatures.
2120003933/Where are those brats? Wait, how many have I had?
2120003934/Beat your wife or her liver will rot.
2120003935/Smacked a few, why?
2120003936/Just one.
2120003937/What?
2120003938/You take issue with fat folk?
2120003939/My head... I raise the mug... and I miss... perhaps I'll retire...
2120003940/Here...
2120003941/150 orens...
2120003942/I'm seeing double...
2120003943/Choose... Two bottles of mandrake cordial, a golden necklace or 150 orens.
2120003944/Return tomorrow - lose another 75 orens.
2120003945/75 orens.
2120003946/Harder than you reckoned?
2120003947/So you in?
2120003948/Later.
2120003949/Weakling.
2120003950/No rules apply.
2120003951/You fighting or running home to Mama?
2120003952/You just pissed off Butter Bean.
2120003953/They're yours.
2120003954/Don't kill me! I wanna live!
2120003955/Could use a bite.
2120003956/Argh, women...
2120003957/Devil's work.
2120003958/What is that kikinightmare?
2120003959/Monster slayers always find employment here.
2120003960/Drop your weapon!
2120003961/I don't want that.
2120003962/It's raining.
2120003963/Damned weather!
2120003964/Brrr... All wet.
2120003965/What a downpour.
2120003966/My regards, mister witcher.
2120003967/Evil! Violent evil!
2120003968/This place stinks.
2120003969/Oo, ouch.
2120003970/Ahem.
2120003971/People, help!
2120003972/Best put that away.
2120003973/My shirt's soaked.
2120003974/Woo-wee, downpour.
2120003975/My foot-wrappings are wet.
2120003976/Expect a flood.
2120003977/Just listen.
2120003978/Begone!
2120003979/You need anything?
2120003980/I lived in the country and have my ways.
2120003981/Meat, bread, fresh milk!
2120003982/Behold the most modern factory in Temeria.
2120003983/Talents are talents, but nothing beats experience.
2120003984/What? Are you an industrial spy?
2120003985/Disturb me and we'll all explode.
2120003986/I'd insure it, burn it, and end with a bigger profit.
2120003987/We'd better adopt gnome technology, or else.
2120003988/That's called progress.
2120003989/Shove off.
2120003990/My paralyzed granny could work harder.
2120003991/Eeeeh... Not quite, but I'm a fish connoisseur. I know! Smoked eel - you'd like that.
2120003992/I love the smell of fish!
2120003993/Yes, many vendors went bankrupt when taxes were increased to support the army. Nonhumans moved to the ghetto and other merchants fear bandits and monsters.
2120003994/Please, have a look.
2120003995/Greetings. Perch? Flounder? Or perhaps a tasty pike?
2120003996/Not that anyone could compete with my goods... I've even invested more in the business, as I expect better times ahead..
2120003997/Alvin admires you.
2120003998/Did the Lady of the Lake appear to you? She doesn't choose just anyone.
2120003999/That pendant you gave Alvin... he believes it a real witcher's medallion.
2120004000/You're a good man, though a witcher.
2120004001/Spare us, we beg you.
2120004002/Well, my vile competitors will surpass me if I don't sell quickly. Never would you believe how many scoundrels seek their fortune in others' misfortune.
2120004003/Well, well... Mercenary? Any war booty to trade?
2120004004/The name matters not, let's trade. I ventured into Old Vizima to buy booty from victors. Do not disappoint me.
2120004005/Abigail sells an ointment for boils.
2120004006/That whoring witch has her eye on me.
2120004007/We're militia. We keep the peace.
2120004008/Stop -- uhh, what are you?
2120004009/We're the militia!
2120004010/We're keeping the peace.
2120004011/Don't know what that means. We gotto check.
2120004012/We needs to see you're not ill.
2120004013/I hope no terrible beasts show.
2120004014/Uh, che... yyy... Well, you look foul, but healthy. Move along.
2120004015/Melitele, save me!
2120004016/Damned elves.
2120004017/We'll all die!
2120004018/I don't want to die!
2120004019/Noooo!
2120004020/How indecent!
2120004021/I hate this weather.
2120004022/What a downpour.
2120004023/Argh... rain...
2120004024/It's not gonna stop.
2120004025/The gods protect me!
2120004026/Melitele, save me!
2120004027/I could use a drink.
2120004028/If not for those monsters...
2120004029/Fish biting, are they not?
2120004030/You can't be serious.
2120004031/How I hate this weather.
2120004032/Not good.
2120004033/What a storm.
2120004034/Oh, it'll rain a while.
2120004035/Their dinner.
2120004036/Plenty, thanks.
2120004037/Yeah, and I love to dance.
2120004038/I like wild flowers...
2120004039/And cross-dressing!
2120004040/Yeah! And hanging around bars...
2120004041/We lumberjacks 'r all right.
2120004042/Yea, we're honest, toil all day, sleep all night.
2120004043/Hmm... we eat lunch, too.
2120004044/We do, we do...
2120004045/There's no end to our toil.
2120004046/Cursed swamp. We'll die here.
2120004047/The pay's laughable.
2120004048/Shut up.
2120004049/The druids are s'posedly getting' friendly with the elves.
2120004050/All the same, the bastards.
2120004051/They're setting us up to be slaughtered.
2120004052/Less the swamp swallows us.
2120004053/They're accustomed to me. Besides, you speak of pike.
2120004054/Don't frighten the fish.
2120004055/Fried perch - an exquisite repast.
2120004056/I might have some fried perch left.
2120004057/I'll say - a basket of fresh fish!
2120004058/More bites here than on the dike!
2120004059/I dreamt the Lady warned me again. She must truly wish me to return my neighbor's spade.
2120004060/If you think you'll cheat us like that rogue Berengar, you're sorely mistaken.
2120004061/Elves by the lake, a procession of dwarves before... Nonhumans flee Vizima like rats from a sinking ship.
2120004062/The Lady of the Lake is good and just, but frightfully angry now.
2120004063/I'm pleased we've settled matters with the fishpeople. As they say, Melitele helps those who live in harmony.
2120004064/I believe you. No one sends a mutated albino to spy. Grant me but one request. Find that armor, so I may win the bet.
2120004065/You jest. Like many, you seek Ruyter's armor.
2120004066/If you truly know nothing of the armor, ask the blacksmith. Everyone knows pieces of Ruyter's legendary armor lie in two nearby crypts, guarded by monsters.
2120004067/I hold no grudge. I simply wagered my brother-in-law, who insists you've come to spy.
2120004068/A member of the legendary dynasty of warriors, Graf Cobus Ruyter inherited a splendid suit of armor. Sadly, the armor couldn't protect him from a crossbow bolt aimed at his temple.
2120004069/Regardless, Ruyter's inheritors quarreled and divided pieces of the armor amongst themselves. They lie in tombs and crypts, drawing adventure seekers.
2120004070/Some legends claim that the Lady herself blessed the armor. Others say magic played a part.
2120004071/Indeed. Do find the armor. I made quite a wager.
2120004072/You can't fool me. You've come to search for the armor.
2120004073/Terrible nightmare. I dreamt of an underwater city and the god of the deep.
2120004074/The grumbling fishermen refused to take me to Black Tern Island.
2120004075/The elves should leave the lakeside.
2120004076/I say this to all: peace with the fishpeople is the best solution.
2120004077/Temeria's largest cow, winner of 7 guild competitions! Straaaaaaaawbeeeeerryyyy!
2120004078/Don't! I wanna live!
2120004079/Wouldn't mind a bite.
2120004080/Argh, women...
2120004081/A witch's doing.
2120004082/What's that kikinightmare?
2120004083/A monster slayer will work here.
2120004084/Drop your weapon!
2120004085/I'm about to get angry.
2120004086/It's raining.
2120004087/Damned weather!
2120004088/Brrr... the rain.
2120004089/Hard rain, no?
2120004090/My regards, witcher.
2120004091/Please, I wanna live!
2120004092/Help!
2120004093/I'd love a bite to eat.
2120004094/Shame...
2120004095/Argh, women...
2120004096/Wasting my time.
2120004097/Aw, this weather.
2120004098/Damned weather!
2120004099/Brrr... I'm wet.
2120004100/It's raining hard.
2120004101/My love stayed behind in Vizima with the children. I long for the end of felling season.
2120004102/Best not wander out into the swamp. A few rookies set forth, never to be seen again.
2120004103/I heard King Foltest intends to put yews under protection. Foolish, indeed.
2120004104/When I return to Vizima, I'll tell my family about the Water Lords.
2120004105/Who is Melitele in the face of the Water Lords' power?
2120004106/Yaren holds the monopoly on herbs. Swore he'd rip out the legs of any caught trading them.
2120004107/We don't call them "brickmakers" anymore. Now they are our "brothers." And we don't say "conversion," we say "rebirth."
2120004108/We were fools to listen to Yaren. There are no lords above the Water Lords.
2120004109/A good leader should have some privileges.
2120004110/Met the brickmakers yet? They are all mad.
2120004111/Down with prohibition!
2120004112/Need another drink.
2120004113/Alllbiiinooooo Tttwinnnnnsss?
2120004114/Guests from afar have arrived for the wedding.
2120004115/Where is Redania?
2120004116/Who would expect such illustrious guests?
2120004117/I dreamt the Lady of the Lake wagged her finger at me angrily.
2120004118/We've forgotten her - what a disgrace.
2120004119/We must seek the Lady's forgiveness.
2120004120/Pulled burrs out of my dog's tail again today.
2120004121/Little do they know a witcher wanders the village.
2120004122/But we can scare them with a witcher.
2120004123/Let's. We'll put them on notice.
2120004124/How is Strawberry?
2120004125/No! That champion cow needs to win again!
2120004126/Due to the wench milking her now. Wisest move Hoffman ever made.
2120004127/The sooner, the better.
2120004128/Riots must've broken out in Vizima.
2120004129/You blind? Elves are fleeing, soldiers along the roads...
2120004130/If the gods will it, war will pass us by.
2120004131/Does it matter? The same folk will die on both sides.
2120004132/Will the wedding take place?
2120004133/I want to know. Wouldn't mind complimentary food and drink.
2120004134/They're plotting.
2120004135/They say Hoffman sent a boy to Vizima about it.
2120004136/When will those elves move on?
2120004137/Nonhumans bring trouble.
2120004138/They're plotting.
2120004139/Hoffman sent a boy to Vizima about it.
2120004140/When will those elves move on?
2120004141/Nonhumans bring trouble.
2120004142/Pot shmot. He found a small box with rolls of paper. He traded it at the store for a new sickle.
2120004143/Why not?
2120004144/Benko found a treasure in his field.
2120004145/He was plowing his field when his blade hit something hard.
2120004146/Stay away from our rusalkas, witcher!
2120004147/Begone, witcher.
2120004148/Noonwraiths are born of heat, grief, and the plough-boy's sweat drops.
2120004149/Naught for free, I know. May that miser Hoffman part with some coin to end this problem.
2120004150/They depart when the sun sets and return when the sun reaches high in the sky again.
2120004151/They dance in the sun and draw in careless wanderers. No man has ever survived a dance with the noonwraiths.
2120004152/They are midday demons, appearing when the sun reaches its zenith. Even children know that.
2120004153/Witcher, those noonwraiths keep us from working the fields!
2120004154/Sadly... Though I know one recipe I haven't been able to try...
2120004155/Bread is 5 orens a loaf and 5 loaves will be 25 orens.
2120004156/Can't say... I would need White Honey, though I know not what that is.
2120004157/Another one! Everyone wants them. I refuse to make them... not for all the gold you have.
2120004158/Course. Witchers are like sorcerers, but worse...
2120004159/Even I cannot resist that amount...
2120004160/All my goods contain finest flour and a secret ingredient from a grateful nymph.
2120004161/I should have kept the sugar doll...
2120004162/You followed the aroma of my fresh bread?
2120004163/How may I help?
2120004164/Got one in the family? Bad luck.
2120004165/Take the doll and go 'fore I change my mind!
2120004166/Yes, their balls have wilted!
2120004167/My sugar dolls ARE NOT FOR SALE!!!
2120004168/White Honey! Incredible... I can now try my secret recipe...
2120004169/Burn the witch!
2120004170/Burn her!
2120004171/Let the Eternal Fire purify her!
2120004172/Devil's whore!
2120004173/Away! Don't come closer!
2120004174/Save me, good people!
2120004175/Hmmm...
2120004176/I need to rest.
2120004177/Hell with it.
2120004178/Hey, that's wrong.
2120004179/Argh, it's drizzling.
2120004180/A storm cometh?
2120004181/Whoosh.
2120004182/Oh, it's raining.
2120004183/Drowners snatched a comrade off his boat.
2120004184/No bigger drunk than a raftsman in his hollowed-out trunk.
2120004185/To reach the swamp, ask the ferryman.
2120004186/I'm a raftsman, not a ditchdigger.
2120004187/You look like the famed White Wolf.
2120004188/The lake grows more fearsome.
2120004189/I hate loading goods.
2120004190/Get lost!
2120004191/I saw them suck the juices from a man.
2120004192/Pure evil. Watch yourself, witcher.
2120004193/You a witcher? You can't imagine the monsters I've seen...
2120004194/Don't open the gate! The beasts will enter!
2120004195/Damn you! We're all going to die!
2120004196/Tomorrow, I'll enlist in the Order.
2120004197/Mistreatment of human by human. Even dwarves don't work so hard.
2120004198/Quiet, or the supervisor will hear.
2120004199/Melitele's teat, what drudgery.
2120004200/I must concentrate.
2120004201/I inherited land but decided to live in the city.
2120004202/May these weapons find elven backsides.
2120004203/Out of here.
2120004204/Siegfried had only kind words for you.
2120004205/Count de Wett called you a traitor consorting with elves...
2120004206/I'm damned proud to make weapons for our boys.
2120004207/A ghoul won't touch the living, whereas a cemetaur kills mercilessly. He consumes the corpse once it's tender.
2120004208/Stay clear of the lakeside. If the Lady of the Lake enchants you, you must serve her for sixty-nine years.
2120004209/I wouldn't mind Julian staying, no matter the tragedy.
2120004210/How dare you, after what you did for the fishpeople?
2120004211/Greetings to our hero!
2120004212/Ha! Always glad to see a foreigner. I once thought o' setting out in search o' happiness.
2120004213/Curse these wedding guests... always under foot and tipsy.
2120004214/Well... quite useful creatures... comely... one shouldn't kill them...
2120004215/Ah, a load off my heart.
2120004216/What say you?
2120004217/The hermit in the fields possesses more books than any here. He serves the Lady, so he must be wise.
2120004218/The king of ghouls, as you doubtless know. All carrion eaters pay homage to that venomous creature -- as greedy for human flesh as a cat is for milk.
2120004219/I beg you, spare any rusalka you catch at the lake.
2120004220/Love for a wench. Then my wife beat any foolish ideas out of me. Perhaps for the better? My brother ventured out and disappeared. They say he was crossing a battlefield dating from the war with Nilfgaard when a cemetaur got him.
2120004221/You look like a vampire.
2120004222/Viziman women wash themselves before going to bed! Heh heh.
2120004223/None can harm me while I wear this turtle stone. Not you, not anyone.
2120004224/Odo no longer drinks with me... Have I upset him?
2120004225/Noooo!
2120004226/Ah, for a drink.
2120004227/Melitele, save me!
2120004228/Now what?
2120004229/Will it rain?
2120004230/Put matters right, witcher.
2120004231/A master of your craft.
2120004232/A witcher! Like the old days!
2120004233/How indecent!
2120004234/I hate this weather.
2120004235/Argh... rain...
2120004236/What a downpour.
2120004237/Look at this rain!
2120004238/I could drink.
2120004239/Melitele, save me!
2120004240/Ah, I'm old.
2120004241/What was I to do?
2120004242/Noooo!
2120004243/You make me laugh.
2120004244/Not good.
2120004245/What a downpour.
2120004246/Argh... rain...
2120004247/It'll rain awhile.
2120004248/Watch where you step, idiot!
2120004249/How can we be rid of the monsters?
2120004250/Let's pray for help.
2120004251/Probably in the swamp searching for herbs.
2120004252/Keep the woman close.
2120004253/Such filth! Right at your door!
2120004254/Yeah, covered in slime, howling like one possessed.
2120004255/What happened next?
2120004256/The Lords' wrath will reach the intruders. Pray we are spared.
2120004257/Vaska left grain on the altar and found a knife there the next morn.
2120004258/Yes, signifies wrath.
2120004259/And the just will live in underwater castles.
2120004260/Ullugh oe'ghal phlaaed n'ogh.
2120004261/I, too, praise the Lords.
2120004262/A new world will appear in the sea.
2120004263/Each sacrifice brings closer the Underwater Kingdom.
2120004264/For nothing is above the Lords.
2120004265/Ullugh oe'ghal phlaaed n'ogh.
2120004266/Are the sacrificial animals ready?
2120004267/I understand not what quarrels humans have with dwarves. Elves are another story. High time we finished them off.
2120004268/Cursed druids'll soon tether themselves to trees.
2120004269/We be simple people. Speak to our leader, Yaren.
2120004270/Finally I see sense in me work - to serve my new gods.
2120004271/The language of the Lords will be our language in the Underwater Palaces.
2120004272/You can be sure I will.
2120004273/So it's a deal.
2120004274/Listen, I've received news that my children in Vizima have fallen sick. I'd like to go back and be with them, but that means I wouldn't make enough for us to survive the winter. So I'd really like to sell some of my old stuff before I go. Interested?
2120004275/I see we're not likely to make a deal.
2120004276/We went through hell to receive a promise of paradise.
2120004277/Well, nothing special. A piece of red ore, a flask of alcohol and a silver ring I inherited from my father. I can throw in the formula for a truly reliable hangover medicine. All this for only 200 orens.
2120004278/Listen, I'm really in need. What would you say to 150 orens?
2120004279/Five thousand yews in three months? My arse! Impossible, even working nights. Schedule, shmedule.
2120004280/Nothing for you.
2120004281/Finally, someone who'll appreciate my wares.
2120004282/Previously, I dealt in farm tools, but lately, weaponry is more profitable.
2120004283/We plan to mate her with the champion bull from Bullsville.
2120004284/Take a good look, mister witcher, you're not likely to ever see another cow like this 'un.
2120004285/That'll be something. A stock known 'round the world...
2120004286/Ah, our strawberry is so bee-auuutiful.
2120004287/Look at her glistening coat, her tail and that udder!
2120004288/Mikul the guard buys hunting trophies.
2120004289/Chickens are dying like flies from the plague.
2120004290/I used to clean the sewers in Vizima. Those were the days!
2120004291/I may join my brother-in-law making bricks in the swamp.
2120004292/For some peace and quiet...
2120004293/Melitele, save me!
2120004294/Goddammit.
2120004295/Up the creek...
2120004296/Out of the pan into the oven, then the fire, and now a witcher.
2120004297/None may say I consort with witchers.
2120004298/Noooo!
2120004299/How indecent!
2120004300/Kill it yourself or find the carcass somewhere?
2120004301/The oracles predicted no rain.
2120004302/When will it stop?
2120004303/My head's wet.
2120004304/Oh. Rain.
2120004305/Help!
2120004306/Curses.
2120004307/Gods dammit.
2120004308/Up the creek...
2120004309/Noooo!
2120004310/Put that away.
2120004311/Rain, good.
2120004312/When will it stop raining?
2120004313/Raindrops forever.
2120004314/More rain.
2120004315/Psst! Tonight after dark.
2120004316/He'll take to the bottle as usual, won't hear a thing.
2120004317/Then I'll go elsewhere.
2120004318/Your beauty would even dazzle a blind man!
2120004319/Oo, a feisty one.
2120004320/And your wit is unsurpassed!
2120004321/Uch, what a tongue on you.
2120004322/Hmm... I'm quite liquored.
2120004323/Don't like you...
2120004324/Mayybee I druunk, but I don' murrder elves....
2120004325/Why hasn't Foltest ordered someone to do something about the plague and the Beast?
2120004326/Then who rules the city?
2120004327/Perhaps the Reverend can send Velerad a letter.
2120004328/Foltest is attending a summit for kings, so says the gate guards.
2120004329/Burgomeister Velerad.
2120004330/A letter would brew more misfortune!
2120004331/The Beast appeared again last night!
2120004332/Near the witch's home, howling to the moon.
2120004333/Where?
2120004334/So the witch wills it to hunt humans!
2120004335/Mikul looks down on us since becoming a guard.
2120004336/It helps when one of your own is a guard.
2120004337/And justifiably so. Not many advance so quickly.
2120004338/He does push favor to the outskirts.
2120004339/That boy can have any village arse he wants.
2120004340/And he's got the appetite, heheh.
2120004341/Quiet down.
2120004342/Waste of words.
2120004343/They're treating their wounded. We can't drive them away.
2120004344/They bother you?
2120004345/They keep quiet, don't pester us.
2120004346/No, he didn't. What slander.
2120004347/They're treating their wounded. Besides, travelers always find hospitality here.
2120004348/They bothering you?
2120004349/They keep quiet, don't pester us.
2120004350/Nonsense. What slander.
2120004351/Why are you telling me?
2120004352/When?
2120004353/What was it? A pot of gold?
2120004354/Wads of paper - some treasure.
2120004355/More witchers wandered the roads in my youth. A dying profession.
2120004356/Though you live long, I wouldn't care to live longer than my father and grandfather.
2120004357/I wished to be a witcher as a child. When I grew up, I thanked the gods that never happened.
2120004358/I dislike all these visitors from afar.
2120004359/Though I can't offer you coin, know that I appreciate what you do.
2120004360/Please accept this small token. I used this whetstone to sharpen my scythe, but you may also use it on your sword.
2120004361/Eternal Fire? Is that some gnome religion?
2120004362/Glad to see someone tending to the monsters around here.
2120004363/I'm booored!
2120004364/I'm scared!
2120004365/Where's my cat?
2120004366/Stupid game.
2120004367/Whitey!
2120004368/My father's sword is bigger!
2120004369/Help!
2120004370/Fie, big deal.
2120004371/I don't want rain.
2120004372/Why's it raining?
2120004373/Kitty's getting wet.
2120004374/Doggy's wet too.
2120004375/Uuuaaaaa!
2120004376/Daddy will buy me a new doll!
2120004377/I'm a drownerette! Hoo hoo!
2120004378/I'm a terrifying flight monster!
2120004379/Help! Grandpa!
2120004380/I don't want that.
2120004381/Rain falling from the sky!
2120004382/The chickens are wet!
2120004383/Hee hee! Everyone's wet!
2120004384/Everyone'll be wet!
2120004385/Nooo!
2120004386/I am!
2120004387/I hate weeding the garden.
2120004388/Maybe later.
2120004389/I'm not afraid of monsters. I'm only afraid the champion cow will get ill.
2120004390/Why not?
2120004391/They don't scare me.
2120004392/Oh my!
2120004393/I'll ask the hermit to make a potion that'll grow me a fishtail instead of legs.
2120004394/Why not?
2120004395/I wanna see the Underwater City one day.
2120004396/I'll be the Lady of the Lake when I grow up, and everyone will love me.
2120004397/The noonwraiths want me to play, but Mama says no.
2120004398/Everyone says you defeated the evil fishpeople. You're our hero!
2120004399/I don't like playing with Alvin. He's weird.
2120004400/Mother called you evil.
2120004401/Greetings. I'm captain of the guard now.
2120004402/Stand aside. We're arresting the troubadour Dandelion for spying for a foreign monarchy...
2120004403/Your status is unclear. You're neither human nor elf.
2120004404/You're under arrest.
2120004405/Long live the king!
2120004406/Our commander forbade us from joining the fight on either side. I don't understand!
2120004407/How reasonable, master Gerant, but only the king can pardon him...
2120004408/Are we the army or damned city guards?
2120004409/Victory is ours!
2120004410/Death to our foes!
2120004411/Spare me!
2120004412/Retreat! Fall back!
2120004413/Any further and I'll shoot!
2120004414/Argh...
2120004415/Charge!
2120004416/By the gods!
2120004417/Enemy in range!
2120004418/The enemy!
2120004419/Amused? Not I.
2120004420/Chaos breeds discontent.
2120004421/No loitering.
2120004422/Enlist in the army.
2120004423/I'd rather man a barricade with a tankard in hand.
2120004424/Stupid patrols. Since when am I a city guard?
2120004425/We're not to rape or pillage. Runs counter to a soldier's nature!
2120004426/I wouldn't mind frisking some whore.
2120004427/Another time.
2120004428/You may wander about at night with a pass... at your own risk.
2120004429/None can explain this state of emergency.
2120004430/...Julian left for Kovir...
2120004431/...The Fisher King netted a water nymph...
2120004432/.. Tobias mourns his daughters...
2120004433/I know all!
2120004434/The temple school, booooring...
2120004435/I'm booored!
2120004436/I'm scared!
2120004437/Where's my cat?
2120004438/Stupid game.
2120004439/Help!
2120004440/Don't want that.
2120004441/Make it stop raining.
2120004442/It's raaaaining.
2120004443/The kitty's wet.
2120004444/The doggy's wet, too.
2120004445/Uuuaaaaa!
2120004446/I prefer my dolls.
2120004447/Let's do something else.
2120004448/Dumb boys.
2120004449/Help! Mommy!
2120004450/I don't want that.
2120004451/I'm getting all muddy.
2120004452/Hee hee, it's raining.
2120004453/Everything's wet.
2120004454/I get bored when it rains.
2120004455/You're it! Hahhaha!
2120004456/Leave me be!
2120004457/I'll be a bar wench when I'm older.
2120004458/My teeth hurt.
2120004459/Where's your lady?
2120004460/Leave me be!
2120004461/One, two.
2120004462/Three, four.
2120004463/Five and ten.
2120004464/I'm a Salamander!
2120004465/Me neither!
2120004466/How about "The Beast comes for you?"
2120004467/When the Beast finds you, you wil die!
2120004468/Wanna play "Dispatching the diseased"?
2120004469/Can you make me a princess?
2120004470/My dog spits blood.
2120004471/Kill my uncle! He's evil!
2120004472/Mother says I meddle.
2120004473/I know everything. Ask me.
2120004474/This is the shore. Beyond lies Murky Waters and beyond that, fields. By boat, you can get to the island.
2120004475/I know something you don't!
2120004476/Yes. Sometimes those evil fishpeople creep out of the water and drive off the funny fishman. I hide under the fisherman's hut.
2120004477/You have white hair, like every grandpa. You're ugly, but I like you.
2120004478/The funny fishman has come back! Those evil fishpeople finished eating from the Lady's altar. Disgusting!
2120004479/Stupid adults. How can you take care of us when you don't understand and you're always yearning...?
2120004480/Of course!
2120004481/You fell out of that strange hole in the sky.
2120004482/Mother also says Alina's sister Celina yearns for Julian. He's Alina's fiancé who lives at the inn. What does yearn mean?
2120004483/Alina, the village chief's daughter, will soon marry... for gold, Mother says.
2120004484/...And I sometimes take fish to the sick and poor elves when the Fisher King catches them. And on the island, you can meet the Lady, more beautiful than Alina! She yearns, too!
2120004485/The submerged city of an ancient race, full of treasure and monsters! Now fishpeople live there. I fear them, but the one sitting by the statue of the Lady seems jolly.
2120004486/Ohhh. Then Julian yearns for Alina, Celina yearns for Julian, and Alina likes Julian's gold but yearns for Adam. Adults are stupid!
2120004487/Heehee, a wart's appeared on your cheek.
2120004488/I'll turn you into a frog!
2120004489/By the fields, the water and Our Lady of the bog, turn my nephew into a frog!
2120004490/Heeheehee.
2120004491/Let's play Lady and Knight.
2120004492/I'll be Lindella!
2120004493/Not like that, silly.
2120004494/Marrieth I her or killeth her?
2120004495/Hoo hoo... I'm a noonwraith.
2120004496/You must fall in love with me and have a moral... delimit.
2120004497/Papa promised he'd fish an enchanted ring out of the Underwater City!
2120004498/I like playing "drowning city" best.
2120004499/I spied on the elves. I'm so brave!
2120004500/I don't like you.
2120004501/That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die.
2120004502/Hmm... a small chapel to some divinity. Who worships here?
2120004503/Interesting, this body has been here long, but something keeps the bones from disintegrating.
2120004504/The bones seem to have petrified.
2120004505/True.
2120004506/Can I be useful?
2120004507/Know anything more?
2120004508/You protect exiles?
2120004509/Killed the garkain. Here's proof.
2120004510/What else can you tell me?
2120004511/Mhm?
2120004512/Meaning?
2120004513/Swords?
2120004514/Farewell.
2120004515/I killed the she-vampire. Here's proof.
2120004516/Why're you here?
2120004517/Give me the silver sword.
2120004518/I'll take the steel one.
2120004519/You worship the Eternal Fire?
2120004520/It's over. You're... well again.
2120004521/Adda? You all right?
2120004522/Don't worry, you're safe. I'll take you home.
2120004523/Farewell.
2120004524/It's this crypt. We should go. You'll feel better outside.
2120004525/Do you feel all right?
2120004526/Know where I might find him?
2120004527/The Professor couldn't have created those mutants. Did he ever mention a mage?
2120004528/All right, I will.
2120004529/It wasn't your fault, don't think about that. It's behind you.
2120004530/I need to ask you about Salamandra...
2120004531/How can I help?
2120004532/Did they incur the king's disfavor?
2120004533/May I ask what prompted your cousins to depart so suddenly?
2120004534/Milady, I have little desire to meddle in political matters.
2120004535/Perfectly. I'll act as messenger, for an appropriate fee.
2120004536/Farewell.
2120004537/As for my fee...
2120004538/Not I, milady. I dance rather poorly.
2120004539/No, milady, I am alone in that.
2120004540/Sounds nice.
2120004541/Your bored cousins fell victim to the local nobility, who imbibed scheming and conniving with their mothers' milk...
2120004542/Hmmm...
2120004543/I'm listening.
2120004544/Do you know the tale of Raven's armor?
2120004545/Is the armor ready?
2120004546/Thank you.
2120004547/Greetings. White Rayla claims you make the best suits of armor in town.
2120004548/I can find the elven minstrel in the swamp cemetery. How about the Litany?
2120004549/Regarding a suit of armor...
2120004550/Thanks. When will it be ready?
2120004551/Can you reforge it?
2120004552/I'm not the inquisition... I was talking about techniques...
2120004553/You use dwarven forging techniques?
2120004554/Greetings. Busy with work I see.
2120004555/Thank you. Farewell.
2120004556/Remind me what I need to do.
2120004557/I'll try.
2120004558/Here, the components you asked for.
2120004559/Could you repeat the legend of Saint Gregory?
2120004560/What will you need?
2120004561/I'll bring you Cobus Ruyter's suit of armor. What else?
2120004562/A singular transformation? The gift of life? You call that enslaved bag of blood and muscles alive?
2120004563/This was your experiment? You're pathetic.
2120004564/This farce is over.
2120004565/I can't wait.
2120004566/You talk too much. Scared?
2120004567/You're bluffing. You send assassins after me, conjure up beautiful words, threaten to kill me. But you're scared to death and simply postponing the inevitable.
2120004568/Your turn, Javed.
2120004569/Berengar?
2120004570/For a second there I wasn't sure if... I'm surprised to see you.
2120004571/Indeed... Problem?
2120004572/Here's the vampire blood.
2120004573/Got some business.
2120004574/Still bored?
2120004575/Don't mention it.
2120004576/Mhm.
2120004577/I know.
2120004578/What profession?
2120004579/Bonhart? Never heard of him.
2120004580/Ready?
2120004581/What is it?
2120004582/Enough about that. I've got some business.
2120004583/Farewell.
2120004584/So be it.
2120004585/Two.
2120004586/Three.
2120004587/Actually - none.
2120004588/Got a lot of work?
2120004589/Just one.
2120004590/I'm relieved you didn't take that on.
2120004591/Antoinette sent me.
2120004592/Farewell.
2120004593/You posted a notice.
2120004594/Here it is.
2120004595/And waiting...
2120004596/Here's your gold.
2120004597/Not yet.
2120004598/I'm not about to give you the coin.
2120004599/There's this red kerchief.
2120004600/If I find anything else you might need, I'll return to trade.
2120004601/I have this golden kerchief.
2120004602/Here's a lady's shawl.
2120004603/I'm looking for herbs.
2120004604/Not exactly the best time.
2120004605/What are you doing here?
2120004606/I've brought fool's parsley.
2120004607/Farewell.
2120004608/A sapphire.
2120004609/I'd suggest putting off your protest, for a long while.
2120004610/Do you have any goods to trade?
2120004611/What do you need?
2120004612/It's yours.
2120004613/This ruby.
2120004614/Amber.
2120004615/I've changed my mind.
2120004616/Great.
2120004617/Excuse me?
2120004618/I am behind the times.
2120004619/I have nothing for you.
2120004620/Here are white roses.
2120004621/I have some precious stones.
2120004622/I found a diamond.
2120004623/Til we meet again.
2120004624/May I ask why?
2120004625/Here's some women's apparel.
2120004626/And the stones and fool's parsley?
2120004627/Sorry, I don't recall an Antoinette.
2120004628/I don't know what you're talking about.
2120004629/True.
2120004630/This matter reeks of political intrigue. And I don't meddle in politics.
2120004631/Yes?
2120004632/Indeed, I have your gold.
2120004633/I haven't met your cousin.
2120004634/Messenger hasn't shown up?
2120004635/The King has hired me...
2120004636/Yes?
2120004637/I did. Here's your gold.
2120004638/Hmmm... No.
2120004639/I don't know what you're talking about. I know no Antoinette.
2120004640/I will.
2120004641/Life is brutal.
2120004642/Is that how you greet all strangers?
2120004643/Who are you?
2120004644/Here.
2120004645/I'll look.
2120004646/I have alp fangs.
2120004647/Good luck.
2120004648/Business looks slow. That groaning must have scared away potential patients.
2120004649/I've a barghest skull.
2120004650/Want more teeth?
2120004651/I found some fangs.
2120004652/I met Zdenek, the famous boxer.
2120004653/Greetings, dwarf.
2120004654/I hope your collection's complete.
2120004655/People dislike you.
2120004656/Here's a cemetaur jaw.
2120004657/Interested in fleder fangs?
2120004658/I found devourer teeth.
2120004659/Zahin Schmartz! Explains the groans... Heard of anesthesia?
2120004660/Take care.
2120004661/Thus the groaning. Heard of anesthesia?
2120004662/People complain of terrible groans coming from this tower...
2120004663/They don't pull teeth by themselves?
2120004664/Generally, yes. Dentists too, but rarely.
2120004665/Does that keep patients away?
2120004666/Geralt of Rivia, witcher, immune to cavities.
2120004667/Strange hobby.
2120004668/This place looks... strange.
2120004669/Sounds doable.
2120004670/All right.
2120004671/I'd like you to recreate Raven's suit of armor.
2120004672/I see.
2120004673/Is the armor ready?
2120004674/Thank you.
2120004675/Our mutual friend, Zoltan Chivay, recommended you...
2120004676/Huh?
2120004677/When should I come back?
2120004678/What would you need?
2120004679/You don't fear attacks?
2120004680/I have a job for you. More complicated than a lightning rod...
2120004681/Thanks, farewell.
2120004682/Remind me what I need to do.
2120004683/I have all the components.
2120004684/Remind me of the spell combination.
2120004685/Consider it done.
2120004686/What tool?
2120004687/We're lovers, nothing more, nothing less.
2120004688/We're lovers, nothing more, nothing less.
2120004689/Sire, I am honored.
2120004690/I'm listening, Sire.
2120004691/Mhm.
2120004692/Triss is a friend and none of your concern, Sire.
2120004693/Triss and I, we're close... That's no one's business but ours.
2120004694/Forgive me, Sire, but...
2120004695/Shani is a friend. She's not involved.
2120004696/Your Highness.
2120004697/Exactly my aim.
2120004698/I have been investigating an organization known as Salamandra.
2120004699/Sire, another disease consumes your kingdom.
2120004700/So I shall. Farewell, Sire.
2120004701/You stood by while the Order's power increased. Perhaps you should negotiate with the Grand Master.
2120004702/Sire, your home also shelters the elves and dwarves you inherited from your ancestors...
2120004703/I understand, Sire, but how can I help?
2120004704/Perhaps you should extend your serene benevolence to the nonhumans, promise them safety and equal rights.
2120004705/Your Highness...
2120004706/I'm certain you're right, Sire.
2120004707/Your Highness...
2120004708/It's possible.
2120004709/Unlikely. Someone must have cast it again.
2120004710/I don't believe so. She'd likely recall all that occurred before her transformation.
2120004711/Thank you, Sire.
2120004712/I understand, Sire.
2120004713/Yes, Sire?
2120004714/I shall take them to the grave with me.
2120004715/I'm honored, Sire, but I must pass.
2120004716/Forgive me, Sire, but we witchers don't meddle in politics.
2120004717/Absolutely, Sire. The nonhumans must pay. With your backing, the Order...
2120004718/As you wish, Your Highness.
2120004719/I won't forget.
2120004720/Shani and I, we're close... That's no one's business but ours.
2120004721/Geralt of Rivia - witcher.
2120004722/You arrived just in time.
2120004723/Thank you for your help.
2120004724/Farewell.
2120004725/Was it Siegfried's knightly duty to discuss my private life...?
2120004726/Mhm.
2120004727/I don't understand...
2120004728/I see.
2120004729/Does the idea include neutral witchers? I hope your vision doesn't turn to nightmare...
2120004730/And the source's name...?
2120004731/Vizima was erected on elven foundations...
2120004732/Don't let me keep you, but I don't like to owe favors...
2120004733/Beautiful words, yet hollow when the cries of the murdered are in the air. I understand - they don't apply to elves and dwarves?
2120004734/Sounds lovely...
2120004735/Sounds beautiful. It's a shame so few real knights remain. To be honest, I've yet to meet one.
2120004736/That's an ideal worth fighting for.
2120004737/And you'll decide who will be awarded the honor of living in an ideal world? That is demagogy, words that conceal a lust for absolute power. After all, you will have to bring those who stray back onto the path... No, Jacques, I'll pass on a paradise like that.
2120004738/Explain, please.
2120004739/Forgive me for not laughing. I just didn't get the joke.
2120004740/I'm in no mood to guess, so why don't you just tell me what made you so bitter. Otherwise, we should part.
2120004741/And how did I earn the interest of the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose?
2120004742/Mhm. Incidentally, thanks for your help.
2120004743/Your way, you mean...
2120004744/Luckily we mutants have no feelings, is that what you mean?
2120004745/You should be used to the sight of fighting by now, Dandelion.
2120004746/Old Vizima awaits...
2120004747/Let's go.
2120004748/Not at all.
2120004749/I agree, but I won't give up now that I'm so close.
2120004750/You sure you want to come?
2120004751/Berengar's letter contained some clues. To start with, we need to get into the city.
2120004752/But matters may get intense...
2120004753/We need to get inside. Finally! I'll find out who's behind Salamandra.
2120004754/Plunder the grave of an elven songmaster. What else?
2120004755/I suspect I know who's behind this. Do you know where it came from?
2120004756/Why are you here?
2120004757/Farewell.
2120004758/What Sign combination should I use?
2120004759/I know some spells.
2120004760/Wraiths. You wanted Death Dust, right?
2120004761/Course. Here.
2120004762/Smoothly. Here it is.
2120004763/I need some more time.
2120004764/I'm glad you enjoyed yourself...
2120004765/I'm having trouble.
2120004766/In your studies of mutation... did you find any cure for infertility?
2120004767/As I expected. Farewell.
2120004768/The king asked me to handle the striga...
2120004769/I brought all the components.
2120004770/No matter.
2120004771/Garkains. Two portions of saliva.
2120004772/Have you heard of Raven's armor?
2120004773/Remind me what I need to do.
2120004774/Is the armor ready?
2120004775/Interesting.
2120004776/The swamp cemetery, Cobus Ruyter, no problem. Anything else?
2120004777/Thank you.
2120004778/Salamandra grows bolder...
2120004779/When will it be ready?
2120004780/Could you recreate Raven's armor if I brought you the components?
2120004781/What's the Sign combination again?
2120004782/Neither, just curious.
2120004783/And all based on stolen witchers' secrets...
2120004784/Kalkstein, I was wondering...
2120004785/Hold it. If not a striga, what is it?
2120004786/Don't get too excited, Kalkstein.
2120004787/Like me?
2120004788/You posted a notice.
2120004789/That's fine, thanks.
2120004790/What rumours? Be quick.
2120004791/All right, but what about this striga?
2120004792/Rayla... What happened to you? I saw you dying and here you are...
2120004793/Shall we test that theory...?
2120004794/You can't afford it...
2120004795/I don't want to fight you. Let me pass.
2120004796/Triss, don't be that way.
2120004797/Triss...
2120004798/Uh... Alvin... vanished into thin air one day. Despite the amulet I gave him.
2120004799/I worried, too. I'm proud of you, heard how you fought for Alvin... Horrible things are happening in Vizima.
2120004800/Any theories?
2120004801/What do you think about the situation with Adda?
2120004802/I've got to go.
2120004803/So you think I should aid the king?
2120004804/If that's what you want, Triss.
2120004805/Who do you think cast the curse?
2120004806/My endgame with Salamandra draws near.
2120004807/Don't tell me - someone replaced the necklace and added crap to the fire...
2120004808/How?
2120004809/Mhmmm.
2120004810/I know the story.
2120004811/No, tell me.
2120004812/What do you think happened to Alvin?
2120004813/I'd need a skilled armorer to remake it... someone with great knowledge of metals... Hmm...
2120004814/What might those be?
2120004815/Namely?
2120004816/Tell me something I don't know.
2120004817/Triss...
2120004818/Uuummm, I don't know. He teleported himself somewhere despite that amulet I gave him.
2120004819/I hope he'll be all right. Triss, I've been thinking... about us...
2120004820/What might those be?
2120004821/It's not like that...
2120004822/Triss, I...
2120004823/We shouldn't deceive ourselves. It's impossible.||Triss, we can't pretend this is possible here and now. We are who we are, and neither of us wants to change...
2120004824/I can't lose you.
2120004825/I... didn't mean it that way. You're closer to me than anyone. I trust you completely...
2120004826/Believe me, Triss. I wish things were different...
2120004827/But we both have things we must do. I don't expect you'd cast aside the interests of the Lodge...
2120004828/I could change, take fewer risks. We'd find Alvin, live together. I'd build a house...
2120004829/I love you, I want to be with you no matter what...||I love you, I want to be with you no matter what. Love is the sole thing of beauty in these rotten times.
2120004830/Thanks, Triss.
2120004831/Not sure, but they looked like mutants. You came just in time.
2120004832/Triss, you're a genius.
2120004833/Salamandra must be based inside the Old Manor.
2120004834/We'll talk later.
2120004835/Let's go.
2120004836/Then let's go.
2120004837/Triss...
2120004838/It's too dangerous, Triss
2120004839/What's the situation at the front?
2120004840/See you, Triss.
2120004841/Good.
2120004842/Ready to cross?
2120004843/I'll tell you later.
2120004844/Yes. The Order of the Flaming Rose.
2120004845/One minute.
2120004846/Grab the oars.
2120004847/Triss...
2120004848/It's not looking good...
2120004849/Exactly. We need to return to Vizima and inform the king.
2120004850/Ah, the secret plan succeeds...
2120004851/How powerful is he?
2120004852/Are you all right?
2120004853/Wild?
2120004854/The leader of Salamandra is dead.
2120004855/What do you know about the Grand Master?
2120004856/In a minute.
2120004857/It could be worse.
2120004858/Greetings, Velerad.
2120004859/Farewell.
2120004860/The king told me about Adda.
2120004861/Make it quick.
2120004862/I'd watch what I say if I were you...
2120004863/Hmmm... Many victims this time around?
2120004864/Know where the striga sleeps in daytime?
2120004865/Certainly, though I grow weary of aiding fools.
2120004866/Aren't you a bit afraid, Velerad? The king looked irate.
2120004867/Understood.
2120004868/I know.
2120004869/Who was Ostrit?
2120004870/What do you mean?
2120004871/We'll see. You seem to remember last time well.
2120004872/Removing the princess' curse will be risky.
2120004873/We'll see.
2120004874/The striga's dead. It's safe now.
2120004875/I do. Farewell.
2120004876/The king wanted to be the first to know.
2120004877/Farewell.
2120004878/The princess is freed. Adda, Velerad will take you home.
2120004879/Someone induced the princess's transformation into a striga. I have proof.
2120004880/Is that all?
2120004881/What's happening in the city?
2120004882/Third time's the charm.
2120004883/I had no choice. The curse could not be lifted.
2120004884/Shutting me in that crypt... Nice gesture, Velerad.
2120004885/Trust is fundamental.
2120004886/I'll fulfill the king's order. Now, show me to the princess.
2120004887/Why are you here?
2120004888/Negotiate, Yaevinn. You have nothing to fear from the king.
2120004889/Just in time.
2120004890/I've made certain of that.
2120004891/Yaevinn! Good to see you.
2120004892/I need to get into the Salamandra hideout in the Old Manor.
2120004893/We'll speak later.
2120004894/Your thoughts?
2120004895/What's the situation at the front?
2120004896/Good luck and thanks.
2120004897/But...
2120004898/Yaevinn, I'm glad to see you survived.
2120004899/All right, thanks.
2120004900/What about you?
2120004901/Cut the rhetoric and grab the oars.
2120004902/I killed the Salamandra leader.
2120004903/Maybe later. I need to get something done.
2120004904/I'll be back in a minute.
2120004905/I must tell the king at once.
2120004906/Not yet. As it turns out, Salamandra is not acting alone. The Order of the Flaming Rose stands behind it.
2120004907/Boat ready?
2120004908/Yes, although not as I had imagined.
2120004909/Where?
2120004910/Great.
2120004911/It's appreciated.
2120004912/The result of Salamandra's genetic experiments.
2120004913/The Old Manor is Salamandra's main base.
2120004914/Farewell.
2120004915/I'm not easy to kill. Nor you, apparently.
2120004916/Must be a powerful sorcerer.
2120004917/I meant Foltest.
2120004918/Never mind, Siegfried. I was thinking out loud.
2120004919/Tell me about the Grand Master.
2120004920/Any magical talents?
2120004921/So he's kept his word...
2120004922/It seems that the Order is behind Salamandra.
2120004923/There's evidence, Siegfried. We should notify the King before it's too late.
2120004924/Excellent.
2120004925/Is the boat ready?
2120004926/Grab the oars.
2120004927/Give me a minute.
2120004928/Lead the way.
2120004929/Wait. I must do something first.
2120004930/The Salamander leader is dead.
2120004931/You won't like this...
2120004932/What's the situation in Vizima?
2120004933/You're not coming?
2120004934/What about you?
2120004935/See you.
2120004936/Hmm... Smell that?
2120004937/Heavy and stifling, like thatched roof huts...
2120004938/The Grand Master gave you the coveted mission of guarding this neck of the swamp...
2120004939/Perhaps, but I see you've been promoted...
2120004940/Care to make an exception?
2120004941/Now's not the best time.
2120004942/What are you doing here?
2120004943/Farewell.
2120004944/I'd suggest putting off your protest, for a long while.
2120004945/Here are ten measures.
2120004946/I'll have that soon.
2120004947/I hear you pay for bloedzuiger blood.
2120004948/Good to know.
2120004949/You were brave.
2120004950/Did you get the medications you needed?
2120004951/I'll accompany you.
2120004952/All right. See you.
2120004953/Where should I escort you? I have several things to do.
2120004954/Take care.
2120004955/Need any help?
2120004956/I'm sorry, Zoltan.
2120004957/Good idea.
2120004958/Your friends should be safe.
2120004959/What's next for you, after the rebellion ends?
2120004960/Farewell.
2120004961/Take care of yourself.
2120004962/I'll manage.
2120004963/I'll take care of the striga. Her lair is somewhere around here.
2120004964/See you.
2120004965/I'm glad I didn't get drawn into the war.
2120004966/Stay close to me. I'll try to avoid any fighting.
2120004967/Glad to help.
2120004968/I heard Shani set up a hospital.
2120004969/She won't be back for a couple of hours... We have plenty of time.
2120004970/I see. Bye, girls.
2120004971/The goddess of love and fertility grant me strength...
2120004972/So be it.
2120004973/Count...
2120004974/Remind me.
2120004975/The king wants me to lift the curse that holds Adda.
2120004976/Farewell.
2120004977/The chance of removing the curse is minimal.
2120004978/Don't you fear the king's anger, De Wett?
2120004979/I do, but I don't care much what people say. I'm interested in the present.
2120004980/Foltest looked pretty pissed. He said something about bloodshed...
2120004981/Have anything specific in mind?
2120004982/I thought I was supposed to lift the curse...
2120004983/Would the rumor mention how much?
2120004984/Nice number. Any idea who's spreading this rumor?
2120004985/I'm not interested in rumors.
2120004986/I'm tired, Count. May I pass?
2120004987/Let me pass, De Wett.
2120004988/She's no longer a problem... I found evidence of a traitor in the princess' entourage.
2120004989/I spent the night with a striga, so my patience runs thin.
2120004990/You're pathetic.
2120004991/You're a worm. I won't soil my boots on a piece of crap like you...
2120004992/That hurt...
2120004993/We'll see...
2120004994/Think you can outsmart them?
2120004995/Who are you working for, De Wett?
2120004996/You're a boil on this city's ass. And boils are lanced with a blade...
2120004997/Not yet, but it's only a matter of time. I discovered a useful diary. Triss Merigold also knows some helpful spells...
2120004998/I never mentioned whose diary...
2120004999/It'll be dawn soon. If I'm to kill her, I don't have much time left...
2120005000/The sun is rising... Just a few moments more and the striga's spell will be broken...
2120005001/Get lost.
2120005002/Find anything?
2120005003/Hurry while the path is clear. I'll see about those monsters.
2120005004/No use looking any further if it's dangerous. We best leave.
2120005005/Why are you here, good man?
2120005006/Hm. Where would I find an armorer capable of making witchers' armor?
2120005007/Tough to believe.
2120005008/Quality over quantity.
2120005009/Interesting...
2120005010/I could use that.
2120005011/No, tell me.
2120005012/I know the story.
2120005013/Why are you looking at me that way?
2120005014/You forgot the ones I killed on the Dike.
2120005015/All right. I'll find him.
2120005016/Which is?
2120005017/I see a twinkle in your eye...
2120005018/I'd drink to that.
2120005019/Now the wounded can receive proper care.
2120005020/I appreciate the inventiveness of dwarves and gnomes, but how was the armor?
2120005021/I do.
2120005022/No, tell me.
2120005023/You know anyone who could create a suit of armor like that?
2120005024/How are you managing?
2120005025/Interesting...
2120005026/Great.
2120005027/I remember the beginning, not how it ended.
2120005028/Sorry, I can't help you.
2120005029/I can't help you.
2120005030/Farewell.
2120005031/Farewell.
2120005032/Farewell.
2120005033/Where can I find him?
2120005034/We'll see.
2120005035/Shoulda drank less wine.
2120005036/Tell me about the drowned dead.
2120005037/A drowner?
2120005038/You've no shame, selling stolen goods!
2120005039/Let's talk.
2120005040/See you.
2120005041/You're safe, for now.
2120005042/I just want to ask something...
2120005043/The city is a ruin.
2120005044/The nonhumans have been ousted from the quarter?
2120005045/Farewell.
2120005046/Looking to occupy all of Vizima?
2120005047/Greetings. Has the fighting with the Order ended?
2120005048/Farewell.
2120005049/What about the knights and the nonhumans?
2120005050/I'm not here to fight the Order or the nonhumans.
2120005051/Farewell.
2120005052/May I see your wares?
2120005053/Do you outfit the Order?
2120005054/Farewell.
2120005055/I'll try not to miss the funeral.
2120005056/Calm down. I just wanted to talk.
2120005057/Greetings.
2120005058/Do you trade with them?
2120005059/Who are the Scoia'tael?
2120005060/I gather they don't like nonhumans around here.
2120005061/Let's trade.
2120005062/Fine.
2120005063/I'm not sure I understand...
2120005064/Why do the locals persecute nonhumans?
2120005065/See you later.
2120005066/Let's talk about weapons.
2120005067/What's so innovative about that?
2120005068/Can I ask you something?
2120005069/Fine, I wouldn't want to cause you trouble. Let's talk about something else.
2120005070/I'll look around for some ore.
2120005071/Uh, I'm not interested.
2120005072/Will I find any around here?
2120005073/Let's talk.
2120005074/Farewell.
2120005075/I'm no mercenary.
2120005076/May I see your wares?
2120005077/Do you supply the insurgents?
2120005078/Farewell.
2120005079/Guess I was generous, then.
2120005080/Shani can't help.
2120005081/Perhaps. I lost my memory.
2120005082/I could use the gold.
2120005083/If you say so.
2120005084/Give me the package. I'll drop it off.
2120005085/I killed the drowners and encountered elves.
2120005086/They were expecting you. Who are they?
2120005087/I'll keep quiet. If it's dangerous, why do you trade with them?
2120005088/Our mutual friend Zoltan sent me.
2120005089/Relax. I only play when I want to.
2120005090/Tell me about the men who wear salamander pins.
2120005091/Thanks for that, at least.
2120005092/Where would I find these drowners?
2120005093/We spoke. They said their entire unit would come back for the rest of the crates.
2120005094/Either way, I did my job.
2120005095/Where can I find them?
2120005096/I see.
2120005097/What do you sell?
2120005098/We'll talk later.
2120005099/I'll think about it.
2120005100/Farewell.
2120005101/My friend seeks a dwarf, Hoog, a Scoia'tael.
2120005102/So you know what it is...
2120005103/No.
2120005104/You're no saint. Afraid of a box? You have so much contraband in stock...
2120005105/Any other work for a witcher?
2120005106/Meaning?
2120005107/Show me.
2120005108/No business of mine. I want my payment. Then you can tell me about Salamandra.
2120005109/We had a disagreement... They're dead.
2120005110/I have gold.
2120005111/I'll help in exchange for information about Salamandra, and throw in 100 orens for my expenses.
2120005112/The Reverend sent me... He thinks you need a witcher.
2120005113/Like I said, I only play when I want to.
2120005114/Listen, I found these strange dice. Looks like dwarven handiwork...
2120005115/You are...?
2120005116/Of course.
2120005117/What do you have to offer?
2120005118/I'm not your errand boy, Haren.
2120005119/I am. What's the problem?
2120005120/I'll take care of her.
2120005121/I see.
2120005122/I'll go immediately.
2120005123/I'd like to return to Vizima.
2120005124/I am.
2120005125/I'll return when ready.
2120005126/Nothing.
2120005127/I am. What is it?
2120005128/What happened?
2120005129/Farewell.
2120005130/Which tower?
2120005131/Tell me more about this striga.
2120005132/Have you seen her?
2120005133/I can imagine the rest.
2120005134/Tell me.
2120005135/I hope you find him.
2120005136/Sorry, I haven't.
2120005137/I seek the striga that has its lair somewhere around here.
2120005138/Farewell.
2120005139/Interesting...
2120005140/She leaves you alone?
2120005141/Seen any Squirrels nearby?
2120005142/I'm here about the notice.
2120005143/Not yet, but I'm getting there.
2120005144/Yes, here they are.
2120005145/Thanks.
2120005146/I better leave the same way I came.
2120005147/I hear sounds behind this wall... There must be something inside.
2120005148/Not you, Zoltan.
2120005149/I hear a cursing dwarf.
2120005150/They better hurry. The knights will arrive any minute...
2120005151/Are we meeting zoologists? How would your friends ever recognize the roar of a polar tiger...?
2120005152/Stunning logic...
2120005153/Stop before you attract some she-tigers...
2120005154/Punctuality is no strength of the elder races...
2120005155/Told you...
2120005156/You'll do nothing of the sort.
2120005157/Too late.
2120005158/Mine's already started. Get out of here!
2120005159/What about you and Yaevinn?
2120005160/Mhm.
2120005161/I was just thinking...
2120005162/Mhm. Toruviel...
2120005163/Why did you return? I thought you had had enough of war.
2120005164/You ran away once already...
2120005165/I see.
2120005166/Your wish is my command.
2120005167/Hm. This isn't the best time...
2120005168/No matter. Thanks for your help.
2120005169/Are you kidding?
2120005170/Ready.
2120005171/I have no idea where the striga might be... Let me help you, maybe we'll happen on the princess' tracks.
2120005172/I spoke with Foltest. I'm supposed to break Adda's curse. She's hunting in the city...
2120005173/I'll talk to Shani.
2120005174/Will your friends be safe here?
2120005175/I can guess.
2120005176/We? You've changed, too...
2120005177/Isn't that a mating call...
2120005178/It looks pretty solid... Any ideas?
2120005179/Genius.
2120005180/The second arrow penetrated her heart. She didn't stand a chance.
2120005181/We need to break through to her.
2120005182/Draw them away from the refugees!
2120005183/Need any more help?
2120005184/Perfect, I also need to go there. We'll sneak through.
2120005185/Nothing can help her now. We should be safe in the swamp soon.
2120005186/They've been feeding on plague victims for months.
2120005187/Hang on. I can see the break in the wall.
2120005188/Not a problem.
2120005189/Of the two, I'd rather face some monsters than get involved in someone else's fight.
2120005190/I guess we just have to wait.
2120005191/Why's that?
2120005192/Greetings.
2120005193/I'm immune to infectious diseases.
2120005194/What's with this plague?
2120005195/Can I ask you something?
2120005196/Let's trade.
2120005197/I'll have to ask the locals.
2120005198/Interesting.
2120005199/Tell me about the Beast.
2120005200/Farewell.
2120005201/May the ground lie lightly upon him.
2120005202/Any bandits in the outskirts?
2120005203/Do these men wear the salamander sign?
2120005204/I'll ask him.
2120005205/You lead.
2120005206/Toruviel?
2120005207/Any purpose to this excursion, apart from killing?
2120005208/Greetings, Rayla. Get your unit back?
2120005209/I see that. They're attacking without rhyme or reason.
2120005210/I'm confident about the outcome.
2120005211/Wait...
2120005212/You win.
2120005213/Looks like I win.
2120005214/Don't mention it.
2120005215/I know other ways to tame you...
2120005216/Who's Renfri?
2120005217/I'm no knight in shining armor...
2120005218/You're deluded...
2120005219/I don't think so.
2120005220/Almost?
2120005221/I don't fight women.
2120005222/You mean yourself?
2120005223/You're mad.
2120005224/Hold on!
2120005225/We'll see about that!
2120005226/No doubt. Are you badly hurt?
2120005227/Looks like your wound was caused by a... hmm... giant cleaver.
2120005228/Siegfried, every child knows to stay away from berserk dwarves. You were lucky.
2120005229/I'm headed that way.
2120005230/Let's move.
2120005231/Amen.
2120005232/What then?
2120005233/I don't need to know that...
2120005234/Carmen, uh, I said I'm not interested.
2120005235/I had to kill him. He was a werewolf, a monster...
2120005236/How are the girls?
2120005237/Good. I hope she's well.
2120005238/I'll try to find her. Farewell.
2120005239/Take care of Vincent. Farewell
2120005240/To talk...
2120005241/I see...
2120005242/I'm glad I could help. While I'm here, any signs of relapse?
2120005243/Have you turned stupid, soldier? Either leave on your feet or die on your back...
2120005244/Who gave you these orders?
2120005245/Can it shield you from a witcher's sword?
2120005246/Forgetting anything?
2120005247/Let's go.
2120005248/In a moment. I must speak to Rayla.
2120005249/What are you peddling?
2120005250/Bad luck. I can't enter the city, either.
2120005251/See you.
2120005252/My pleasure.
2120005253/I want to finish off Salamandra.
2120005254/I see. I'd like to be on my way, Sire.
2120005255/Your Highness...
2120005256/What's the situation in Vizima?
2120005257/Some people I care about need help.
2120005258/After you, milady.
2120005259/Rayla, wait!
2120005260/Shani, watch out!
2120005261/I must speak with Toruviel.
2120005262/Let's move.
2120005263/Won't be easy.
2120005264/Have a minute?
2120005265/What are you talking about?
2120005266/Do you have a minute?
2120005267/You've set up a hospital...
2120005268/Now?
2120005269/But...
2120005270/I've seen worse in town...
2120005271/They shouldn't bother you anymore. See you later.
2120005272/False alarm. Some mutant was attacking the soldiers...
2120005273/Shani, please stay out of this!
2120005274/I'll handle this.
2120005275/I'm sure you will, though I'd rather you escaped.
2120005276/You're the best healer in Vizima. It's your calling, your future. You used to talk about going back to the academy, about teaching.
2120005277/A lovely...dream. ||A lovely...dream. But to make it real, we must wait until all this madness ends.
2120005278/Clash of weapons! Shani, please don't get involved!
2120005279/Wait, I'll check!
2120005280/I'll be back...
2120005281/There, there, everything will be all right.
2120005282/Would you like me to kiss you? Is the offer still open?
2120005283/Not worried about knights of the Order or elves showing up? They both think you're treating the enemy.
2120005284/That's not so easy. I found him in Murky Waters... The village was attacked by men from the Order. Alvin took fright and teleported off. He could be anywhere.
2120005285/Shani...
2120005286/Shani...
2120005287/No more than anyone else.
2120005288/Battle...
2120005289/Shani...
2120005290/Let's not fool ourselves. It's impossible, not here, not now. ||Let's not fool ourselves. It's impossible, not here, not now. We are who we are, and neither of us wants to change.
2120005291/Mmm... Shani, I've thought a lot about us... A life together, a family...
2120005292/Alvin? I have no idea where to look. He could be anywhere.
2120005293/I don't want lose you either, but I don't want to hurt you. I'm a witcher, I lead a dangerous life. I could never forgive myself if something happened to you...
2120005294/No, that is your path. I have no right to take it from you. I have no right to deprive you of a normal life.
2120005295/Stay inside. I'll handle this.
2120005296/I'm thrilled.
2120005297/I'll see you later, captain. Stay safe, Dandelion.
2120005298/Calm down, Dandelion, I'll see what I can do...
2120005299/Dandelion, calm down. I'll talk to Velerad, he should be willing to help...
2120005300/I need to get into Old Vizima. I stand a chance of getting in alone, but not with... Do you follow?
2120005301/It's true. I'm not suited to converse with kings...
2120005302/Greetings, Vincent. Why are you here?
2120005303/Has Foltest returned?
2120005304/Looks quiet...
2120005305/What are you doing here?
2120005306/You all right, Zoltan? Haven't started taking fisstech, have you?
2120005307/What's wrong?
2120005308/Spare me. What's going on?
2120005309/Yadda-yadda-yadda.
2120005310/I'll try breaking through to her.
2120005311/Shani's in Old Vizima?
2120005312/Have proof?
2120005313/The elven civilians have returned a few blows.
2120005314/How'd that happen?
2120005315/Naturally.
2120005316/Maybe the Grand Master wanted to provoke nonhumans.
2120005317/Stretching my legs...
2120005318/As day. The Order is the enemy, not the Scoia'tael...
2120005319/Of course.
2120005320/Sire.
2120005321/Sire, the striga... gave me no choice. I had to...
2120005322/How is Adda feeling?
2120005323/It's a deal.
2120005324/Yes?
2120005325/As day. The Grand Master, rather than the Order as a whole, is the kingdom's enemy.
2120005326/Those responsible assumed your position would be undermined if the princess wreaked havoc as a striga. De Wett has been punished.
2120005327/King, sorceress and witcher united againt evil... Worthy of a painting. But all will be lost if we delay any longer. Sire, one other matter...
2120005328/You'll restrain them longer and instruct them not to look hard... in gratitude, for we'll rid you of Jacques de Aldersberg... Sire, one other matter...
2120005329/You count your wyverns before they hatch. Jacques de Aldersberg is alive and well. Sire, one other matter...
2120005330/Sire, your wish is my command.
2120005331/It's a deal.
2120005332/What?
2120005333/I thought you'd be interested, Sire.
2120005334/What?
2120005335/Sire, Adda...
2120005336/It is time for you to choose your allies, and you must choose well, Sire.
2120005337/I'm a witcher, not a hit.... All right, 10 thousand.
2120005338/I'm glad Adda is alive and well. Can you ensure that the witcher's friends will be the same, Sire?
2120005339/He wanted to gain influence with your enemies.
2120005340/As you wish, Sire.
2120005341/On Salamandra's orders.
2120005342/...directed all of Salamandra's actions and intentionally provoked the uprising.
2120005343/He was acting on behalf of the Order.
2120005344/De Wett transformed the princess...
2120005345/I'm not a hitma... All right, it'll cost you - 10 thousand.
2120005346/A-hem, forgive me, Your Majesties, but I feel it's time I...
2120005347/What the hell is that?
2120005348/He said,"Stop deliberating, son, we need to put out the fire in this whorehouse."
2120005349/Stop being dramatic and tell me what's happening.
2120005350/I need to finish something.
2120005351/You'll never change...
2120005352/We can't pass through the city without the king's consent. You're still a wanted elf.
2120005353/We?
2120005354/Dandelion, I'm glad you're alive, too, but I have important matters...
2120005355/Triss, tell this clown to get to the point.
2120005356/He won't be as long as I'm here.
2120005357/This part of the Order is on our side.
2120005358/The Grand Master must feel confident.
2120005359/De Aldersberg knows that history is written by the victors. If he wins, he'll blame the nonhumans or the king...
2120005360/The Order doesn't guard it?
2120005361/This place has a strange effect on me.
2120005362/It's had a lot of fresh meat. I hope it hasn't had time to procreate.
2120005363/I'd rather they made their own decisions.
2120005364/Don't get eaten.
2120005365/We need to give them the chance. Let's go.
2120005366/Damn, I'm out of potions. Could I ask you to...
2120005367/Zeugls don't need mates. They're hermaphrodites.
2120005368/Stay out of range of its tentacles. Zeugls harbor all kinds of contagion. If you have any spells against infection...
2120005369/Avoid its tentacles, they're his chief weapon. His torso's his soft spot. Drink any venom antidotes you have now.
2120005370/Have sympathy. They've lost their homes and loved ones. Prayer helps them accept their fate.
2120005371/We'll have a chance to fight yet.
2120005372/Under their shining armor, it's all rot.
2120005373/Could be tough. Let's go.
2120005374/What's the situation, captain?
2120005375/You're bleeding heavily. Not good.
2120005376/Knights may be waiting.
2120005377/This place has a strange effect on me.
2120005378/I'll come back for you.
2120005379/Then we're in time.
2120005380/You won't. Ever heard of a freedom fighter dying while wading through crap?
2120005381/Come on, Yaevinn, let's cut off this hydra's head.
2120005382/I hope it hasn't had time to multiply.
2120005383/Don't move, Foltest's armies will be here any minute.
2120005384/Your prayer will have to suffice.
2120005385/Fine, I'll pray.
2120005386/Are you kidding?
2120005387/Lie down, Siegfried...
2120005388/Siegfried, I'm not a believer. Doesn't that make prayer useless?
2120005389/This looks too easy. Why don't the elves use this passage? Am I missing something?
2120005390/Zeugls are hermaphrodites. They don't need a mate to make little zeugls. They do it with themselves.
2120005391/You may have no choice. They're out to kill.
2120005392/I'm afraid we're about to get a closer look at the Grand Master's regiments than we ever wanted to.
2120005393/Well, you proved better with a sword. Expect to see more of these monsters in Vizima.
2120005394/Right. This place has a strange effect on me.
2120005395/Enough pessimism.
2120005396/Not exactly.
2120005397/I didn't know...
2120005398/Depends on us.
2120005399/Nice to hear.
2120005400/Greetings.
2120005401/What do you have in mind?
2120005402/Not sure...
2120005403/I don't care about prophecies. I care about the lives of ordinary people.
2120005404/Poor girl?
2120005405/Farewell.
2120005406/Carmen, it wasn't like that...
2120005407/I'm sorry, Carmen.
2120005408/I did it for your own good.
2120005409/Did they hurt you?
2120005410/But you need to know...
2120005411/Tell me.
2120005412/I need to get to the monastery.
2120005413/On an important mission for the king.
2120005414/I must go. Farewell.
2120005415/Destiny...
2120005416/We won't stay long. We need to get to the monastery.
2120005417/We'll risk it.
2120005418/Where does it lead?
2120005419/You're right.
2120005420/Is there another route?
2120005421/Is there a safer way to the monastery?
2120005422/Thank you.
2120005423/I'm here on a matter of national importance.
2120005424/Sorry, you give me no choice.
2120005425/You're mad...
2120005426/The other is death.
2120005427/Reverend? Why are you here?
2120005428/What are you going on about?
2120005429/Thanks.
2120005430/Calm down. How do we get out?
2120005431/There were monsters in the cellar...
2120005432/De Aldersberg will stop at nothing. We must break through.
2120005433/Between a rock and a hard place, huh?
2120005434/I'll remember that.
2120005435/I must go. Farewell.
2120005436/Let's say I believe you.
2120005437/Well, a talking ghoul.
2120005438/I see war is to your liking, Vetala.
2120005439/I know many intelligent monsters that are deadly.
2120005440/You think you can trick me? I'm a witcher, not a child.
2120005441/The inhabitants of this home have no objection?
2120005442/Why are you here?
2120005443/I see.
2120005444/How did you get here?
2120005445/Prospering, dwarf?
2120005446/Sorry to hear that, but I need to go. Farewell.
2120005447/You might be able to brainwash young elves with your slogans, but they don't impress me, nor did they impress those you murdered...
2120005448/I see a blind fanatic about to perish.
2120005449/You're using her as an excuse to kill more civilians. At least have the balls to admit that.
2120005450/Open your eyes, Yaevinn. Your beloved war killed her. Stop drowning the world in blood. Try building for a change.
2120005451/You're blinded, Yaevinn, eager to sacrifice all for your love of war. The hatred you've incited for years killed Toruviel. If you must die to understand that, so be it.
2120005452/I'm in no mood for riddles...
2120005453/He'll stop at nothing. We must break through.
2120005454/Do you enjoy working for a madman? Do you murder for pleasure or simply to follow orders?
2120005455/You're the one who's wrong.
2120005456/Leave if you value your lives.
2120005457/And the civilians?
2120005458/By turning civilians into food for mutants?
2120005459/Then leave the civilians alone and fight the real enemy.
2120005460/A knight of the Flaming Rose defending monsters before people? How low have you fallen? Draw your sword and die with dignity.
2120005461/Then don't force me.
2120005462/The Grand Master is a madman. He'll stop at nothing. We must break through.
2120005463/Your mother has a wise son.
2120005464/I promise to get rid of those beasts.
2120005465/I can't do anything about nightmares, kid.
2120005466/Finding anything interesting as you loot?
2120005467/I just have a question.
2120005468/Later.
2120005469/I won't harm you.
2120005470/Later.
2120005471/What are you selling?
2120005472/Looting houses?
2120005473/Another monster.
2120005474/They're mutants, beings against all nature.
2120005475/They're no ordinary monsters.
2120005476/I can' open this door without a key.
2120005477/Enough. Our swords will speak for us.
2120005478/I also have an offer - surrender. Withdraw your mutants. Humble yourself before the king. You'll save many lives.
2120005479/You took them, as if they were your own. You're a theif, a hypocrite.
2120005480/They treat people like you at Saint Lebioda's Hospital...
2120005481/Save your rhetoric for the plebs.
2120005482/You have yet to say how all this ice justifies your crimes.
2120005483/Where are we?
2120005484/Humanity's also a passing phase. But unlike elves, we won't leave much behind.
2120005485/Another lie. You provoked the nonhumans!
2120005486/Why fight it then?
2120005487/The good of the few you hand-picked to survive.
2120005488/You see human traits as weaknesses? I pity you.
2120005489/Jacques de Aldersberg, your dream is over.
2120005490/I doubt you mean it. You stole our secrets from Kaer Morhen -- used them for the worst ends!
2120005491/What plan, dammit?
2120005492/Juggler's tricks. I expected more.
2120005493/Trust your daydreams that much?
2120005494/With you leading them?
2120005495/Why so obsessed about other races?
2120005496/You're rambling, De Aldersberg. What do you want?
2120005497/What sin?
2120005498/You robbed humanity of its right to decide. You understand nothing.
2120005499/Every criminal claims a higher cause.
2120005500/I do. You sound pathetic, De Aldersberg, as if you believed your own lies.
2120005501/But you chose how to use it.
2120005502/And pursued it by ending hundreds of others. How many more do you aim to condemn?
2120005503/Bullshit. You wanted power.
2120005504/I see no humans here.
2120005505/They're human?
2120005506/I thought you died.
2120005507/I didn't know they were human.
2120005508/What humans? As always, you're perplexing.
2120005509/True, Your Highness.
2120005510/M'Lady, your wish is my command.
2120005511/Foltest will let him disappear.
2120005512/Seems I'll never find rest.
2120005513/I'm tired, Dandelion. I want peace and quiet.
2120005514/You're exaggerating again. Something ends, something begins. I'll take the last of the stolen secrets, take a deep breath, and move on.
2120005515/Hardly a pleasant nap. Was I out long?
2120005516/Enough philosophy, Dandelion. I did what I had to and now I'll be on my way.
2120005517/I don't know.
2120005518/Only now do I feel my new life beginning.
2120005519/Is she all right?
2120005520/How's Siegfried?
2120005521/I wonder how he'll manage as Grand Master.
2120005522/Yes. I'll take the final element from Jacques and close this chapter.
2120005523/What do you mean?
2120005524/Maybe it was his way of repeling hostile magic. Or it was there to control inborn abilities, unrelenting visions...
2120005525/I don't know. It looks the same but older. He must've worn it under his armor for years.
2120005526/Know what I found on the Grand Master? A dimeritium pendant.
2120005527/Yes. I'll take the final element from Jacques and close this chapter.
2120005528/A new ballad? Sounds too pompous, Dandelion. Take a look around. Life is simple, unpredictable, and beautiful.
2120005529/Yes. I'll take the final element from Jacques and close this chapter.
2120005530/Caught between the king, her sorceress friends, and her personal life...
2120005531/Dandelion? Where's the Grand Master?
2120005532/And Yaevinn?
2120005533/End of story.
2120005534/It doesn't matter. Jacques de Aldersberg, if that was his name, is dead.
2120005535/Salamandra is dying, soon to be a memory...
2120005536/I was afraid you'd suggest chess...
2120005537/Words, words, words...
2120005538/Gladly.
2120005539/Gibberish, specter. Tell me what you want or disappear. I believe that's what I said, and I will say it again if you don't get to the point.
2120005540/One second...
2120005541/I remember nothing.
2120005542/Never. This is between him and me.
2120005543/The question is whose.
2120005544/Gibberish, specter. Tell me what you want or disappear!
2120005545/Take him. I don't care what fate he meets.
2120005546/Jacques de Aldersberg is mine.
2120005547/True, but for my reasons, and they are nothing to you. Clear off while you can. Go before it's too late.
2120005548/Stop!
2120005549/Stop!
2120005550/Stop!
2120005551/There's always choice.
2120005552/I know it's hard to act contrary to your feelings.
2120005553/Those thoughts always come too late.
2120005554/Ours was a tumultuous relationship, but that's in the past. What do you want, specter?
2120005555/There are worse things than dying in battle.
2120005556/You, here? How?
2120005557/An illusion, Shani.
2120005558/As long as I get the Grand Master at the end.
2120005559/This place or this time?
2120005560/Why?
2120005561/Very well. Thank you.
2120005562/I understand. You had to fight for dignity. You had no choice.
2120005563/We all make choices throughout our lives.
2120005564/Was I supposed to let myself get killed? That's not my style, Toruviel.
2120005565/Why are elves such fatalists? You could have escaped, yet chose to fight.
2120005566/How did you get here?
2120005567/How?
2120005568/See you, Triss. I'll be back.
2120005569/So this isn't real?
2120005570/Why?
2120005571/It's just an illusion, Triss.
2120005572/I trust your judgment.
2120005573/Let's go, then.
2120005574/What are you going on about?
2120005575/Go to hell, De Wett.
2120005576/Enough, Yaevinn.
2120005577/You resorted to murder and terrorism. That's no alternative.
2120005578/Try me now.
2120005579/Have the courage to face me, Jacques! Stop hiding behind specters and illusions! I'll find you!
2120005580/I wanted no part of politics. I'm a witcher, I'm neutral.
2120005581/A coup d'etat, murder, experiments on children - too high a price.
2120005582/All right...
2120005583/Will do. What did Vesemir mean about me and sorcerers?
2120005584/Mhm. Is this your first real fight?
2120005585/Stay close.
2120005586/I'll pass.
2120005587/I'll take it.
2120005588/I need to rest...
2120005589/I'd like to order...
2120005590/Got any rooms? I need to rest.
2120005591/Take care.
2120005592/Could it have been the mage we saw?
2120005593/Meaning?
2120005594/We'll see.
2120005595/What should I expect from the mage?
2120005596/NOT_USED
2120005597/NOT_USED
2120005598/NOT_USED
2120005599/NOT_USED
2120005600/NOT_USED
2120005601/So what do these potions do?
2120005602/Any side effects?
2120005603/Thanks.
2120005604/NOT_USED
2120005605/NOT_USED
2120005606/NOT_USED
2120005607/Why does the Wild Hunt occur?
2120005608/Really?
2120005609/Who would that be?
2120005610/And how do they all know that?
2120005611/What a coincidence.
2120005612/See you.
2120005613/You guessed right, those ballads are about me.
2120005614/I wouldn't mind hearing something.
2120005615/Some do. Those songs must be popular.
2120005616/Hm. What's in your repertoire?
2120005617/Mosses and Grasses - the smell is heady.
2120005618/They once laid me down here...
2120005619/All that's missing is a mage who'd know how to use this...
2120005620/Hmmm... Seems witchers have always been better with a sword than with a paintbrush.
2120005621/Witcher George slaying the dragon...
2120005622/Defending common folk... Inspiring.
2120005623/Tell me about the Trial of the Grasses.
2120005624/I'll do that.
2120005625/Does everyone pass the first stage?
2120005626/I have some questions.
2120005627/I presume it's more than your basic lettuce and carrots.
2120005628/Interesting. What's the cost?
2120005629/What's the second stage?
2120005630/I think I've heard enough.
2120005631/I need more alcohol.
2120005632/I get it. So what happened to Alfred's discovery?
2120005633/You really think Triss never used magic to peek inside?
2120005634/Eskel, you know I need practice.
2120005635/Witchers use swords. If anyone raises a hand against me, I'll cut if off.
2120005636/All right.
2120005637/So why haven't you shown her the lab?
2120005638/You seem to feel at home here.
2120005639/Did you see the magic storm?
2120005640/Eskel, I have amnesia...
2120005641/The changes are irreversible?
2120005642/Couldn't Triss have helped with Leo's mutation?
2120005643/Quite a cut. And the last stage?
2120005644/Did you ever witness a Trial?
2120005645/Can I have some more alcohol?
2120005646/I'll talk to Vesemir.
2120005647/What do I use as the base for my potion.
2120005648/We'll talk later.
2120005649/Yes.
2120005650/No.
2120005651/You dislike Triss?
2120005652/Temerian Devil sounds familiar...
2120005653/The Fiery Dancer sounds interesting...
2120005654/Leo said he almost defeated you.
2120005655/I'll be in trouble if I don't get my memory back.
2120005656/Thanks, Lambert.
2120005657/For instance...
2120005658/Start with the basic styles.
2120005659/Any thoughts on the attackers?
2120005660/We'll speak later.
2120005661/I wouldn't mind hearing about monster fighting techniques.
2120005662/I've heard enough, thanks.
2120005663/I think I've heard enough.
2120005664/Tell me about the Viroledan style.
2120005665/Can you tell me about the fighting styles witchers use?
2120005666/But they had a mage and a frightener. They robbed us and killed Leo.
2120005667/What happened?!
2120005668/Lead the way.
2120005669/Follow me.
2120005670/A Sign?
2120005671/I don't remember the Signs.
2120005672/All right.
2120005673/The magic barrier looks solid. We need Triss.
2120005674/All clear.
2120005675/Let's get back before Lambert kills the frightener himself...
2120005676/We'll see in a minute.
2120005677/I'm glad we talked.
2120005678/So, outdrank you!
2120005679/Farewell.
2120005680/Thanks.
2120005681/Don't I get a prize for winning?
2120005682/Always give strangers such a warm welcome?
2120005683/We'll do what we can, Vesemir...
2120005684/Let's go!
2120005685/Nah. But if those were magic lights, I'd hate to face a truly powerful sorcerer.
2120005686/Savolla's eating dirt. That's what matters.
2120005687/I'm coming.
2120005688/I'm coming.
2120005689/What?
2120005690/Go! We'll deal with him and join you at the barrier!
2120005691/They're coming...
2120005692/Alone?
2120005693/Maybe we should split up.
2120005694/Be careful.
2120005695/The lab is important. I'm going with Triss.
2120005696/I'll handle the frightener with Vesemir.
2120005697/Vesemir?
2120005698/The bandits are in the lab, searching for something. The mage used the Circle of Elements to create a magic barrier...
2120005699/Well, no time for that now.
2120005700/How much chance?
2120005701/True.
2120005702/Know anything more about the sorcerer who ransacked the lab?
2120005703/Except maybe what I feel as I look at you.
2120005704/The theft... what are its possible consequences?
2120005705/What about wealthy merchants, dukes, kings?
2120005706/I need to do something. I'll come back and get you when I'm ready.
2120005707/Unfortunately.
2120005708/It's not your fault. You helped us.||Nothing to forgive. What I felt when I learned you were alive... hard to compare to anything.
2120005709/As always?
2120005710/They broke into the lab, killed Leo, stole our mutagens, and escaped...
2120005711/We delayed the funeral until you awoke.
2120005712/Everyone makes mistakes. Let's get back...
2120005713/Who?
2120005714/I hope this potion helps.
2120005715/I'll be back soon.
2120005716/Can you restore my memory?
2120005717/I'm glad you're feeling better.
2120005718/Sure.
2120005719/Triss. I'm not ready to talk about the past...
2120005720/We shouldn't keep Vesemir waiting.
2120005721/I suppose we have some time...
2120005722/We have no time to lose, Triss. The sooner we set off the better.
2120005723/I'll see you at the funeral.
2120005724/Thanks. Let's go.
2120005725/I know a bit about the game.
2120005726/Watch out. Love wanes, he'll be back for his gold.
2120005727/My pouch is as empty as a smith's bellows.
2120005728/Can you make a good living at dice?
2120005729/I'm not surprised. I don't doubt you fleeced him.
2120005730/And where in Vizima would I find someone willing to play?
2120005731/Who is this hunter you played?
2120005732/Honest? Why choose me? No one else is willing to sit down with you?
2120005733/Farewell.
2120005734/NOT_USED
2120005735/NOT_USED
2120005736/Fine.
2120005737/You could've told me about the stairs...
2120005738/Just reconnaissance or...
2120005739/No matter. The Professor and the other mage must be hiding in the Keep...
2120005740/We'll see what's happening inside and be back.
2120005741/Fine.
2120005742/Is it safe up top?
2120005743/He attacked the Professor... I was late...
2120005744/Lambert? He doesn't hate Triss?
2120005745/I'll find you later.
2120005746/That's a relief.
2120005747/I see.
2120005748/I can do that. How do I make the potion?
2120005749/And the bandits...?
2120005750/I have all the ingredients.
2120005751/Do you and Triss argue often?
2120005752/Hm. Thanks.
2120005753/Are there other witchers?
2120005754/Why isn't he here?
2120005755/Can I have another frightener claw?
2120005756/Can I have another frightener claw?
2120005757/Lambert gave me the formula.
2120005758/Vesemir, we can proceed with the funeral.
2120005759/What if I get the ingredients wrong?
2120005760/Did I know him?
2120005761/Mhm.
2120005762/Where?
2120005763/Some always run.
2120005764/We'll speak later.
2120005765/Can I have more of that herb?
2120005766/I do. What next?
2120005767/Where are Lambert and Eskel?
2120005768/You mentioned defending Kaer Morhen before.
2120005769/I'm sorry.
2120005770/Can I have more of that herb?
2120005771/Who was Leo?
2120005772/I found a few intruders upstairs, but...
2120005773/Any idea who attacked?
2120005774/She was able to salvage some equipment... But it looks like the main devices vanished...
2120005775/I finished off several marauders upstairs.
2120005776/If I'd gone with her, I might've tended to Savolla...
2120005777/I need to do one more thing.
2120005778/Can I ask you something?
2120005779/Lambert, I have to tell you something...
2120005780/What do I do now?
2120005781/Leo... The bandits killed him...
2120005782/I'll find you later.
2120005783/Where's the Calcium Equum again?
2120005784/Where can I get some alcohol?
2120005785/No time to talk. I need to make a potion for Triss.
2120005786/Done. I have the ingredients. And it's safe upstairs.
2120005787/I have the Calcium Equum and White Gull.
2120005788/Farewell.
2120005789/We'll see.
2120005790/Farewell.
2120005791/We'll see.
2120005792/Farewell.
2120005793/Bring it on!
2120005794/Take care.
2120005795/Indeed.
2120005796/Some tournament going on?
2120005797/Tell me about this tournament.
2120005798/I don't have 25 orens.
2120005799/Interesting...
2120005800/Simple and specific.
2120005801/My reward?
2120005802/Shut up.
2120005803/How much?
2120005804/Another time.
2120005805/The ring.
2120005806/I'm in.
2120005807/Gold.
2120005808/The vodka and chaser.
2120005809/You an experienced fist fighter?
2120005810/Any rules?
2120005811/I'm broke.
2120005812/I defeated Fat Fred, so I'm looking for another opponent.
2120005813/I win!
2120005814/You have a heavy hand and a head of solid stone...
2120005815/What's the wager?
2120005816/I'll pass.
2120005817/Yes, why?
2120005818/No.
2120005819/What's the wager?
2120005820/Right.
2120005821/The necklace.
2120005822/I'm in.
2120005823/The gold.
2120005824/The mandrake cordials.
2120005825/Huh?
2120005826/Any rules?
2120005827/I don't have enough.
2120005828/Until...?
2120005829/You were a warrior?
2120005830/Right.
2120005831/I'm a witcher. I win.
2120005832/Relax...
2120005833/How about a wager?
2120005834/After one punch?
2120005835/Did he...
2120005836/I see.
2120005837/I've heard enough.
2120005838/Another time.
2120005839/What happened?
2120005840/I'll take the magical sign and the runic stone.
2120005841/I'm in.
2120005842/I want gold.
2120005843/I'll take the meteorite steel and the runic stone.
2120005844/And Gablodda. I'm looking for a worthy opponent.
2120005845/No rules apply?
2120005846/I don't have 500 orens.
2120005847/Sounds ominous.
2120005848/Who with?
2120005849/We'll see about that.
2120005850/I need to prepare.
2120005851/What's the wager?
2120005852/I'll take the best of all runes.
2120005853/I'm in.
2120005854/I'll take the coin.
2120005855/The meteorite steel.
2120005856/Hmm...
2120005857/You don't look like a famous boxer.
2120005858/But...
2120005859/Better luck next time.
2120005860/Good guess.
2120005861/Always.
2120005862/I have a question...
2120005863/No.
2120005864/They say you have no name.
2120005865/A few? They said you were undefeated!
2120005866/It happens.
2120005867/Right here in my hand, I'm afraid.
2120005868/Not surprising, you're pretty quick.
2120005869/I got rid of the ghouls in the crypt.
2120005870/I found a young woman's body inside. The ghouls came for her.
2120005871/I wouldn't know her name. It appears she poisoned herself.
2120005872/Who?
2120005873/Relax, Mikul. I'm just asking.
2120005874/I'll drop by.
2120005875/Zoltan told me. Don't worry, I play the game, too.
2120005876/You say you burned your dice... but I think you're lying.
2120005877/I see.
2120005878/Wolves, you say?
2120005879/Mikul, I need to enter the city. I have a pass.
2120005880/You fear them, just like the villagers.
2120005881/They're bandits. The guards should do something.
2120005882/I'm looking for the men who wear salamander pins.
2120005883/Let me think about it.
2120005884/I'll come back later.
2120005885/Of course.
2120005886/I see. Let's talk...
2120005887/Have you let anyone in?
2120005888/Apologize to Ilsa, Mikul...
2120005889/Farewell.
2120005890/Zoltan, you say...
2120005891/I found these strange dice. Dwarven handiwork...
2120005892/Monsters? What kind?
2120005893/Got any problems around here?
2120005894/I've seen no knights here. Would the Reverend know anything?
2120005895/Where might I get a pass?
2120005896/I'm sorry for your loss, but I need to know about Salamandra.
2120005897/Where would I find these ghouls?
2120005898/See you later.
2120005899/I'm a witcher, so I'll rid you of the fiends, but in exchange, you'll pay me 200 orens and tell the Reverend I helped you.
2120005900/Hm. Dead'uns, you say...
2120005901/Dead'uns?
2120005902/The Reverend said you could use my help...
2120005903/And I guess the commander's inside... Does this quarantine apply to everyone?
2120005904/Will it last long, this quarantine?
2120005905/What do you mean "what"? I want to enter the city.
2120005906/Don't forget to tell the Reverend I got rid of those ghouls... Farewell.
2120005907/This is pointless.
2120005908/What tribute?
2120005909/Let me pass.
2120005910/Godspeed.
2120005911/I'll be going.
2120005912/What's that?
2120005913/I'm immune.
2120005914/A witcher.
2120005915/The goods are Haren's. Sorry, Aen Seidhe, but I can't let you touch those crates.
2120005916/The drowners shouldn't bother you anymore.
2120005917/Doesn't matter. Don't touch those crates.
2120005918/Greetings. I don't speak your language.
2120005919/Fine, take the goods.
2120005920/I'm not sure I like your tone. Haren didn't mention you... I was hunting drowners.
2120005921/Give me the gold. I have no use for the rest.
2120005922/Sorry, I'm working for Haren. You'll have to find your hawkers' specialties elsewhere...
2120005923/Farewell.
2120005924/I guess I see your point...
2120005925/You have something of mine...
2120005926/Who's Azar Javed?
2120005927/We'll see.
2120005928/This is a scintillating conversation, but it's time for some action.
2120005929/Too bad. Let's dance!
2120005930/Where's Berengar?
2120005931/Did you say I work for murderers?
2120005932/You a soldier?
2120005933/I noticed that suit of armor.
2120005934/You play dice?
2120005935/You know what this is?
2120005936/Hiccup, mhm.
2120005937/Calm down. I've no desire to hurt you. I just need to ask you a few questions.
2120005938/Where's their lair? You have nothing to fear.
2120005939/Odo, it seems you wanted to cheat mister Gervant.
2120005940/Relax, I'm no soldier.
2120005941/I risk my neck for you, and you try to cheat me... Don't forget to tell the Reverend I helped you.
2120005942/Now listen here...
2120005943/I'm a witcher, a monster slayer.
2120005944/Of course.
2120005945/I'm Geralt. Now you know my name.
2120005946/Later.
2120005947/Weed it out,' you hypocrite? Zoltan told me you play dice gladly.
2120005948/See you.
2120005949/Tell me more...
2120005950/Anything stranger than that?
2120005951/Any monsters around?
2120005952/I'll show you what I can do.
2120005953/Ever seen the sign of Salamandra?
2120005954/The Reverend?
2120005955/We agreed on 100.
2120005956/I've slain the monsters in the garden. Pay up.
2120005957/That's no job for a witcher.
2120005958/I'll see what I can do, for 120 orens.
2120005959/What's the problem then?
2120005960/I'm no gardener.
2120005961/The Reverend sent me to help you.
2120005962/We'll talk later.
2120005963/Let's drink then.
2120005964/120 and not an oren less.
2120005965/I said 120.
2120005966/Strong stuff. How about 100?
2120005967/You asked for it...
2120005968/What's your business with this dwarf?
2120005969/You'd be better off moving along...
2120005970/Sheath your weapon. And stop waving those arms around if you want keep them.
2120005971/Don't let me get in your way...
2120005972/Some other time maybe. Tell me about this place.
2120005973/Don't let me trouble you. Godspeed.
2120005974/The chapel looks altered...
2120005975/What are you guarding?
2120005976/That dog seems to be looking for something.
2120005977/Watch those echinops thorns, pup...
2120005978/Seems the contents of that bottle caused the woman's death. The ghouls came for her remains.
2120005979/Hm, these crates look a lot like Haren's... That son of bitch is trading with Salamandra!
2120005980/Locked.
2120005981/Can't get up there. I need another way out.
2120005982/From the blood and dents, this armor's a warrior's. But this fatso's more familiar with tankard than sword.
2120005983/I wonder what this man-shaped doll is for?
2120005984/Fresh graves. Plague must have visited.
2120005985/Fresh wounds. Judging by their size, it must've been the Beast...
2120005986/Looks like Miss Vesna has unwanted visitors.
2120005987/Vesemir.
2120005988/Too much time to stop Salamandra from stealing the alchemy equipment.
2120005989/But battling the frightener took time.
2120005990/That mutated dog was just the beginning.
2120005991/Eskel.
2120005992/Leave them on their own to save useless filters and flasks?
2120005993/Lambert.
2120005994/The plot thickens. They've begun experimenting.
2120005995/Things would be different if I had gone with Triss.
2120005996/A new threat... And I know why we now face it.
2120005997/"Almost" makes a huge difference...
2120005998/To use the stolen secrets Salamandra needs equipment.
2120005999/Without it, the witcher's mutagens are useless.
2120006000/They almost succeeded at Kaer Morhen.
2120006001/They almost grabbed Kalkstein, and his treasures.
2120006002/I know all too well what they're after.
2120006003/If I had stayed and fought the frightener with Vesemir, I might've faced a different threat today.
2120006004/I wanted no part of the business between the hawker and the Scoia'tael.
2120006005/The fools gave me no choice.
2120006006/And the scavengers will be fat and sated.
2120006007/Ravens and crows...
2120006008/Fearing the revenge of the Scoia'tael, Haren betrayed the whole unit.
2120006009/Use their deaths, take just revenge, for the cause.
2120006010/The young nonhumans will be carrion for ravens and crows...
2120006011/Probably thought he'd be safe, get a reward...
2120006012/The only true victors in this conflict. For someone is sure to avenge the freedom fighters.
2120006013/Hawkers' specialty.
2120006014/They're used to kill civilians, for show, as a cruel warning.
2120006015/Fragmenting tip. Enters the stomach as one, exits the back as three, mincing the internal organs.
2120006016/Useless against armored soldiers. The tips burst on the surface of even the lightest armor.
2120006017/I know where the weapons that killed Coleman came from...
2120006018/I need to avoid those situations, remain neutral, not get involved.
2120006019/A surprise in the sewers...
2120006020/Soaked in stench from head to foot.
2120006021/I must say he did rather well... for a human.
2120006022/I usually work alone, but this was an opportunity to see a knight in action.
2120006023/A knight of the Flaming Rose.
2120006024/That was rare gratitude he showed...
2120006025/Witchers work alone.
2120006026/Guarding the hospital - better than dying in darkness from a razor sharp beak.
2120006027/Siegfried would have slowed me down, been easy prey for the cockatrice.
2120006028/It also teaches humility and patience...
2120006029/Humans are helpless in the darkness beneath Vizima.
2120006030/And I was left to hunt in peace.
2120006031/His torch attracted all the drowners.
2120006032/I lost the skirmish in the swamp. Javed made off with the book.
2120006033/This marked the true beginning of our conflict.
2120006034/Though Javed escaped once more, on balance things are rather favorable.
2120006035/And the Professor for dessert.
2120006036/Three Salamandra bases annihilated, new allies gained.
2120006037/Javed crumbled in the swamp...
2120006038/He lost it, fled.
2120006039/Javed ran, leaving the Professor behind.
2120006040/Alzur's Shield worked beautifully.
2120006041/He could easily have destroyed me and made off with the spell book.
2120006042/I won't let him escape next time.
2120006043/Whatever lives in that cave is far from friendly!
2120006044/Refused to know the truth, refused to acknowledge anything that might blemish the deceased's good name...
2120006045/His men respected him.
2120006046/A deadly monster.
2120006047/Tried to control his thirst for blood, select his victims, but he was a beast.
2120006048/Captain Vincent "Werewolf" Meis.
2120006049/They should've listened to reason...
2120006050/They had to eliminate the captain's killer to prevent this truth from getting out.
2120006051/Lost causes are worth a struggle.
2120006052/A fairytale...
2120006053/...True love can still work wonders.
2120006054/A fairytale...
2120006055/Tough cop, whore from the slums, true love.
2120006056/In a world dominated by scorn and meanness, a world full of bandits and murderers...
2120006057/Love that overcomes a powerful curse.
2120006058/The world's changing. And Vincent's a decent... werewolf.
2120006059/A dark avenger, keeper of peace.
2120006060/A changing world, new, more dangerous monsters-- fisstech, slavery, banditry unpunished.
2120006061/I let Vincent live.
2120006062/Werewolves are no longer the enemy, no longer the evil lurking in the dark.
2120006063/A deadly beast.
2120006064/"All this to keep your coin safe - absolutely safe."
2120006065/Don't believe the hype...
2120006066/The forces are balanced. Rumors of riches stolen from the bank have drawn food and weapons suppliers.
2120006067/"Masterful locking spells."
2120006068/Riches that humans stole from Vivaldi earlier.
2120006069/"Battle-hardened war veterans."
2120006070/"500 years of experience."
2120006071/"Mahakaman safes designed by gnome engineers."
2120006072/The Scoia'tael won't admit it, but the fight for freedom is easier on a full stomach, in decent armor...
2120006073/One should never negotiate with terrorists. Negotiation leads to concessions.
2120006074/Concessions are a victory for terror. Folks become fearful, uncertain.
2120006075/They agreed to support the crusade against nonhumans...
2120006076/The bank's new owners were grateful for the Order's intervention.
2120006077/We won't need to wait long to see the results...
2120006078/I chose the lesser evil.
2120006079/Maybe I should've made an exception...
2120006080/Not anymore...
2120006081/Don't get involved, don't play the wandering knight, don't do law enforcers' work for them-- that's what they drummed into my head...
2120006082/Get involved? Stick my neck out on some principle?
2120006083/Did I choose the lesser evil?
2120006084/The Reverend and his flock made a choice...
2120006085/I'm a witcher. I neither judge nor punish. I solve human problems...
2120006086/...Not always using a sword.
2120006087/No.
2120006088/Why did I save Abigail...? Were her honor or virtue threatened?
2120006089/Because the law was being broken?
2120006090/No.
2120006091/No.
2120006092/What was I thinking?
2120006093/I'm a witcher.
2120006094/Someone who will care for her, not wander the world risking his neck for a handful of coin.
2120006095/At least I stopped short of proposing.
2120006096/I miss them... her.
2120006097/Pick-up sticks? Maybe we could settle down together? Hmm...
2120006098/Somtimes I truly regret...
2120006099/I have no right to put her and Alvin in that position.
2120006100/Shani deserves someone normal.
2120006101/Happiness never lasts.
2120006102/I miss them... her.
2120006103/The Salamanders don't know the concept of mercy, they'd stop at nothing.
2120006104/I'm a witcher.
2120006105/I wasn't made to be a father.
2120006106/Sometimes I truly regret...
2120006107/I had no right to expose Alvin that way.
2120006108/Decision time. A turning point.
2120006109/But you can't always straddle the fence.
2120006110/The Scoia'tael showed new strength at Murky Waters. I saw it in Toruviel's eyes...
2120006111/I could've stayed out of it.
2120006112/I just hope it's not a costly one.
2120006113/Even old Zoltan Chivay talks of hope, victory.
2120006114/I promised the Reverend I'd light this for the night.
2120006115/The skirmish at Murky Waters was the first of several victories for the Order...
2120006116/I just hope the victory is not too costly.
2120006117/The uprising nears its end.
2120006118/Decision time. A turning point.
2120006119/I chose to fight. Neutrality gone.
2120006120/Stand aside or fight nonhumans?
2120006121/Everyone disapproved...
2120006122/I chose neutrality. I'm a witcher.
2120006123/Ideals aren't worth dying for, especially if they're based on hatred...
2120006124/Decision time. A turning point.
2120006125/I found my path.
2120006126/He knew that facing Javed alone was suicide, for either of us.
2120006127/Berengar made his decision.
2120006128/He knew where Javed was hiding.
2120006129/He also knew I'd find the sorcerer sooner or later.
2120006130/Unnecessary duel, unnecessary death.
2120006131/Almost nothing.
2120006132/Nothing good came of it.
2120006133/Maybe he intended to face Javed...
2120006134/I can't fathom where Berengar got that medallion.
2120006135/As long as there was a chance I could save the princess, I had to try.
2120006136/Few know we draw greater satisfaction from removing a curse or a spell.
2120006137/People see witchers as monster-slayers.
2120006138/Rightly so.
2120006139/It was worth it.
2120006140/Swords are a final resort.
2120006141/The union of the two largest northern kingdoms fell through.
2120006142/Claws like a wildcat and red, irate eyes.
2120006143/Four-feet tall and a body like a barrel of beer.
2120006144/A mouth from ear to ear, filled with dagger-like teeth.
2120006145/The young Redanian monarch soon gained a nickname that accurately described his nature and the policies he pursued toward his neighbors.
2120006146/I doubt King Radovid would've wanted a bride like that.
2120006147/Radovid the Stern.
2120006148/Shut your mouth, Reverend, or you'll taste my steel. Everyone -- listen. There is to be a trial - a trial, not a murder. I've had enough of your pathetic problems. You can wallow in this crap yourselves.
2120006149/It's time, Abigail.
2120006150/I want no part of this.
2120006151/Hm, a notice board.
2120006152/Maybe I can find some witchers' work...
2120006153/Let's go. We need to deal with the Beast.
2120006154/NOT_USED
2120006155/You have two options. Wait until I leave and then murder Abigail - but then I'll come back. I'll slay every lice-ridden peasant, anything that moves and can't climb a tree. Or you can try to lead honorable lives, clear your conscience, start again - like humans. The choice is yours.
2120006156/Shove off and maybe I'll let you be...
2120006157/I'd like to see you try, pleb.
2120006158/Is that so?
2120006159/No one is burning anyone.
2120006160/Don't be afraid.
2120006161/Son of a bitch.
2120006162/Back off.
2120006163/Abso-fucking-lutely beautiful...
2120006164/NOT_USED
2120006165/You're making a mistake. This man's a murderer.
2120006166/I can't wait.
2120006167/NOT_USED
2120006168/Did you forget it would put you face-to-face with a witcher? Well, I'd be foolish not to take advatnage of this situation.
2120006169/Where did you get the idea to assume Raymond's identity?
2120006170/Enough chatter. Now kindly lead me to where you've hidden the items stolen from Kaer Morhen.
2120006171/More than you think. Just one question...
2120006172/I only see you.
2120006173/Good, I was getting impatient. What do we do now that we have the treasure from the tower? How do we lure the mage here?
2120006174/All felt the battle in the swamp was the beginning of events that would soon rock Temeria.
2120006175/A routine skirmish between patrols erupted into a regular battle.
2120006176/The Scoia’tael learned that freedom could only be achieved by shedding blood, their enemies' and their own.
2120006177/It was the last time I was able to avoid taking sides.
2120006178/Sensing the aproaching conflict, both sides were eager to test the enemy.
2120006179/Azar excluded me from the battle. When Triss woke me, heaps of bodies appeared before my eyes.
2120006180/Led by unwavering faith, the knights of the Order showed greater determination and emerged victorious.
2120006181/I should check his pockets...
2120006182/The innkeeper...
2120006183/All felt the battle in the swamp was the beginning of events that would soon rock Temeria.
2120006184/A routine skirmish between patrols erupted into a regular battle.
2120006185/The Order learned the nonhumans are a foe far more dangerous than previously assumed.
2120006186/It was the last time I was able to avoid taking sides.
2120006187/Sensing the aproaching conflict, both sides were eager to test the enemy.
2120006188/Azar excluded me from the battle. When Triss woke me, heaps of bodies appeared before my eyes.
2120006189/The Scoia'tael were determined, their longing for freedom was strong, and they proved victorious.
2120006190/No sign of Javed or the Professor. This bunch should cave easily. Let's do this...
2120006191/Triss?
2120006192/How?
2120006193/As the condemned I have the right to a last wish - one last kiss from you.
2120006194/Not much. I know you plan to stage a coup, assume power while your father is away. I also know you found an ally in Salamandra.
2120006195/Your Highness... Adda.
2120006196/The better you know me, the more impressive I become.
2120006197/Those crates look familiar, like Haren's goods that I saved from the drowners. The son of a bitch is trading with Salamandra!
2120006198/Have any work for me?
2120006199/Innkeeper, do that again and I'll get angry. Wouldn't want that, would you?
2120006200/All right. I'll just tend to my business and be on my way...
2120006201/I'm a witcher...
2120006202/Good man.
2120006203/I said I wanted a beer.
2120006204/An edifying tale... Thanks.
2120006205/Give me a beer.
2120006206/I'll pass.
2120006207/It's time I was on my way.
2120006208/I'll take it.
2120006209/Got a room?
2120006210/Thanks.
2120006211/I found these strange dwarven dice.
2120006212/No... But innkeepers know a lot.
2120006213/All right, I'll look around.
2120006214/I'm looking for someone who stayed at this inn.
2120006215/Do you for five orens?
2120006216/Okay, I'll speak with him.
2120006217/Why the gloom?
2120006218/M'Lady...
2120006219/Thank you, m'Lady.
2120006220/I want to get Alvin out of here. I cannot allow him to be harmed in any way..
2120006221/Alvin, no!
2120006222/Berengar... mysterious witcher and outcast... I finally found him.
2120006223/Expect to see me, Grand Master. Soon.
2120006224/Javed's dead.
2120006225/Finished? Because if you are...
2120006226/Ha. You, savior of the world?
2120006227/I've heard Ithlinna's prophecy.
2120006228/You're deluded if you think the sight of women and children will make me leave you alone.
2120006229/You suspected Salamandra sent me to kill you. The same with Berengar.
2120006230/Oh yeah. I can smell your fear.
2120006231/But Berengar disappeared. Your man, however, did learn something.
2120006232/I need to talk to you about Salamandra.
2120006233/I have some questions.
2120006234/Best tell me all you know... The name Azar mean anything?
2120006235/No problem.
2120006236/Why don't I believe you?
2120006237/You're working for Azar.
2120006238/Someone wanted me to believe you led Salamandra.
2120006239/Wait. I'd rather you were dead...
2120006240/Hear me out. Javed murdered Raymond and is now impersonating him using an illusion. He tried to manipulate me into killing you. That would help him a lot.
2120006241/See you.
2120006242/I despise your kind.
2120006243/I see, settling scores in the underworld.
2120006244/Your people attacked me at the hospital.
2120006245/He was a friend. I suspect Salamandra had something to do with his disappearance.
2120006246/Hmmm... that's interesting...
2120006247/I'll think about it.
2120006248/I've figured out Javed.
2120006249/I'll be back.
2120006250/Neither, Ramsmeat.
2120006251/What do you do?
2120006252/And I'm a priestess of Melitele...
2120006253/When I ask about Salamandra, your henchmen get shifty.
2120006254/Why did you contact witcher Berengar?
2120006255/In that case, let's call it a misunderstanding. Sorry about your boys.
2120006256/Want the truth about Salamandra?
2120006257/Actually...
2120006258/Thanks. That helped.
2120006259/I'll get you...
2120006260/I know you're fighting Salamandra... I'm hunting them, too.
2120006261/I'll be back.
2120006262/They belonged to a witcher. How'd you get them?
2120006263/Uh, how's things?
2120006264/Ever seen the Salamandra sign?
2120006265/You'll be dead before you count to three.
2120006266/No.
2120006267/He was my brother.
2120006268/I'm short on proof, so let's say I'll leave you alone for now.
2120006269/Not really.
2120006270/You and yours get nervous whenever you see the Salmander sign.
2120006271/Nothing unusual, given that you're battling them for influence.
2120006272/Maybe Kalkstein has some ideas.
2120006273/Not much. He was badly injured.
2120006274/I'll tell him I did you in, but you have to lay low for a while. If your boys attack him, he'll just flee...
2120006275/I've been to Thaler's place. Found a few things there, belong to someone I'm looking for.
2120006276/Let's summarize...
2120006277/They'll carry you out. Feet first...
2120006278/Let's say I believe you.
2120006279/I think I have this figured out.
2120006280/Your boys were really nervous. Nervous and aggressive.
2120006281/NOT_USED
2120006282/NOT_USED
2120006283/NOT_USED
2120006284/Farewell, Sire.
2120006285/Your Highness, Master...
2120006286/Where am I?
2120006287/I remember nothing.
2120006288/Not much... Look below... I know the moves: pirouette, parry, cut...
2120006289/I can't explain it but I feel a bond when we speak. I know you were important...
2120006290/I need to think.
2120006291/Mhm... I owe my recovery to you... Thank you, Triss.
2120006292/Watch out!
2120006293/Later.
2120006294/Neither do you.
2120006295/Where?
2120006296/I'm looking for the private eye, kid.
2120006297/Thanks, kid.
2120006298/I can see that.
2120006299/Watch out!
2120006300/Smashed ribs, punctured lung. He's dying.
2120006301/Leo, stop!
2120006302/Vesemir....
2120006303/Leo is dead.
2120006304/NOT_USED
2120006305/Triss...
2120006306/See you, Triss.
2120006307/That's fine. Which way should I go?
2120006308/NOT_USED
2120006309/Leo, stand back.
2120006310/Come on, Professor...
2120006311/I need to wait for the storm...
2120006312/Have you decided what to do with the peasants yet?
2120006313/You'd best flee, the Order is bound to send a unit after you.
2120006314/Why are you here?
2120006315/What's happening?
2120006316/Thanks for the message.
2120006317/Can't mediatate with the fire out. Seems I have to light it first.
2120006318/I'd rather fight.
2120006319/Don't know any Bonhart. Who paid for my head?
2120006320/As day. Bye.
2120006321/Good.
2120006322/I'd rather know what I need to pay you to find proof of my innocence.
2120006323/Doesn't matter, you won't collect the reward anyway. Draw your sword.
2120006324/Who're you?
2120006325/I doubt you're looking for a drinking buddy...
2120006326/Good to know.
2120006327/You've had enough.
2120006328/What do you do?
2120006329/Laaaauuughing...
2120006330/I hear you deal with Thaler.
2120006331/Had a parcel for you from Haren.
2120006332/Just asking.
2120006333/Like where?
2120006334/Seen a witcher before?
2120006335/The city guards took it.
2120006336/Made a killing, did you?
2120006337/Who are you?
2120006338/No grudge?
2120006339/I'll make it up to you. What's it worth?
2120006340/I'll get you the coin.
2120006341/I don't have it, so forget it.
2120006342/100 orens - compensation for the parcel.
2120006343/Take it before I change my mind.
2120006344/Ran into your boys outside.
2120006345/Anyone else wants to try, do it now. I'm in a hurry.
2120006346/Friends is something we'll never be. Bye.
2120006347/Watch your step.
2120006348/Looking to hire a witcher?
2120006349/Yes?
2120006350/Ghosts?
2120006351/Okay.
2120006352/Can't help thinking a good glazier could eliminate those draughts...
2120006353/I don't have time for bullshit.
2120006354/Ever seen the Salamandra sign?
2120006355/But...
2120006356/Let's talk about Salamandra.
2120006357/What do you sell?
2120006358/Should've guessed.
2120006359/Right.
2120006360/See you.
2120006361/But...
2120006362/It seems this place is drained of the Power.
2120006363/Tastes awful. Let's hope this does more than freshen your breath...
2120006364/Why would I do that? For some of Vivaldi's gold?
2120006365/You're giving Toruviel no choice, and now you need me to kill the knights.
2120006366/Arms bought for stolen gold... admirable. If you've come from Vizima, then you led White Rayla here!
2120006367/What do you want?
2120006368/Why would I do that? For some of Vivaldi's gold?
2120006369/Looking to recruit me? Am I to stand with Rayla and kill the elves before they murder the hostages? Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just walk.
2120006370/But let me guess... though she's a mercenery, she has her honor and keeps her word. Yet she's prepared to avert a massacre of civilians, even if that means the elves will escape...
2120006371/I spoke to Rayla. Heard enough for today...
2120006372/Good. Two worms with one stone.
2120006373/I need to keep her near the sarcophagus if I'm to lift the curse. She'll be stronger there, but it's worth a try.
2120006374/You sound like Zoltan...
2120006375/Finally, the acknowledgement I deserve.
2120006376/That seemed like a nice chat...
2120006377/Matter of fact I do. By the way, you never paid me.
2120006378/Why not?
2120006379/You're not doing too well.
2120006380/Ahem... Any idea who?
2120006381/Had a parcel for you from Haren.
2120006382/The city guards took it.
2120006383/No grudge?
2120006384/I'll make it up to you. What's it worth?
2120006385/I'll get it.
2120006386/I don't have it, so forget it.
2120006387/100 orens - compensation for the parcel.
2120006388/Take it before I change my mind.
2120006389/Ran into your boys outside.
2120006390/Anyone else wants to try, do it now. I'm in a hurry.
2120006391/Friends is something we'll never be. Bye.
2120006392/Watch your step.
2120006393/Tell me about the effects of fisstech.
2120006394/Neither. So long.
2120006395/See you.
2120006396/You'll make a good swordsman yet.
2120006397/You beat Lambert?
2120006398/Haunts you? In your bedchamber?
2120006399/I'm listening.
2120006400/Why the grief?
2120006401/It will cost you 200 orens if I succeed.
2120006402/I don't think I'm interested.
2120006403/I've dealt with your husband.
2120006404/Tell me more, maybe I can help.
2120006405/You didn't mention proof. I want my gold.
2120006406/So long.
2120006407/Quiet down, aren't you afraid of being seen in the company of a witcher?
2120006408/Where will I find you when I'm done?
2120006409/Why can't I collect payment when I want?
2120006410/Just asking if you've seen him.
2120006411/Any idea who inhabits the water hut on the island beyond the village?
2120006412/Know any other uses?
2120006413/You're not making much sense.
2120006414/I was thinking about paying work, but all right, I'll take you there.
2120006415/Piss off, bum.
2120006416/I'm looking for a child, the brickmakers' little boy.
2120006417/Just curious.
2120006418/They call me all kinds of things, mostly Geralt or scabbed freak.
2120006419/I'm looking for work.
2120006420/You're a damned cannibal.
2120006421/I'm not your son, gramps.
2120006422/None taken. But I'm likely to earn some trekking through this swamp.
2120006423/I need to get inside.
2120006424/What was that?
2120006425/Thanks, gramps.
2120006426/Tell me about the mage's tower.
2120006427/I'm looking for beggartick blossoms. Do you know the herb?
2120006428/I was hoping for something more useful, but I'll try that.
2120006429/Take care.
2120006430/Die, monster!
2120006431/Fine, you'll live... for now.
2120006432/You don't deserve to live!
2120006433/Like I believe you. You'll flee as soon as I leave.
2120006434/I won't be swayed. Die, cannibal!
2120006435/Why do you eat human flesh?
2120006436/That could be useful.
2120006437/And the meat?
2120006438/Plates, a mug...
2120006439/Just looking around.
2120006440/I'm looking for a child, the brickmakers' little boy.
2120006441/What was that?
2120006442/Thanks, gramps.
2120006443/Just asking if you've seen him.
2120006444/I find that hard to believe.
2120006445/Enough.
2120006446/Truly praiseworthy...
2120006447/What about dwarf meat?
2120006448/I'm done listening to you, bastard.
2120006449/Spare me.
2120006450/Shut up, you son of a bitch.
2120006451/Goodbye.
2120006452/Is that skull and brain... human?
2120006453/What reasons might a cannibal have?
2120006454/You're crazy, gramps.
2120006455/You're not making much sense.
2120006456/You remember when the mage was alive?
2120006457/Tell me about the mage's tower.
2120006458/I need to get inside.
2120006459/Not today.
2120006460/Try showing me.
2120006461/See you.
2120006462/How about 50 orens?
2120006463/Thanks.
2120006464/Have things calmed down?
2120006465/I'll take the gold.
2120006466/Any unusual entertainment on offer?
2120006467/That's nice.
2120006468/Only a little?
2120006469/All right.
2120006470/Maybe someday.
2120006471/Surprise me.
2120006472/I see.
2120006473/You're on your own?
2120006474/I'm no materialist.
2120006475/That's no job for a witcher.
2120006476/Mark them on my map.
2120006477/I'll see what I can do. Where can I find these men?
2120006478/No doubt.
2120006479/Many girls like you working in Vizima?
2120006480/Carmen, care to come to a house party?
2120006481/Agreed. Here's the address...
2120006482/Any work for a witcher?
2120006483/That's how they'll know who I am?
2120006484/Let's talk.
2120006485/I'm no poet, but I can tell a peach when I see one.
2120006486/Go on...
2120006487/All right, I'll give that some thought.
2120006488/Why?
2120006489/What profession is that?
2120006490/Never heard of him.
2120006491/A witcher.
2120006492/Was he a mage?
2120006493/I'm here about the notice.
2120006494/I'll return when I have the pelts.
2120006495/Who was Bonhart?
2120006496/I do. Ten wolf pelts.
2120006497/Farewell.
2120006498/But he's dead. As they say, he hit a harder rock than he was himself...
2120006499/He's not me.
2120006500/Do I look scared?
2120006501/I've done all you asked. Where's the Salamandra hideout?
2120006502/Crumbling?
2120006503/To do that, I need to know where to find them.
2120006504/One more thing...
2120006505/Yes?
2120006506/May I have it?
2120006507/I'd like to bury a man in the crypt beneath the church.
2120006508/I'm not Berengar.
2120006509/Fire won't scare the Beast. This is more than a stray dog.
2120006510/All right, but it will cost you 100 orens.
2120006511/Why?
2120006512/I'm looking for men who wear salamander shaped pins.
2120006513/What can I do?
2120006514/I told you it wouldn't work. Where's my payment?
2120006515/So be it.
2120006516/Indeed there is. I seek Salamandra. I heard they come here.
2120006517/Remind me -- what was the story with the fire and the chapels?
2120006518/Fine.
2120006519/Odo's and Haren's monsters are gone. For Mikul, I cleared the crypt of ghouls.
2120006520/I know where the Beast comes from.
2120006521/The Beast appeared because of human wickedness. To slay it, I'll need to identify the guilty.
2120006522/Tell the villagers to stay at home now. I don't want anyone getting hurt...
2120006523/So it's a deal?
2120006524/I'll take the sarcophagus.
2120006525/But...
2120006526/And if I were to do something for you, to deserve that honor?
2120006527/I hear the Church of the Eternal Fire has offered a reward for drowners.
2120006528/I have drowner heads. My reward?
2120006529/I'll return with proof.
2120006530/I want to enter the city, but I need a letter, a pass of some sort.
2120006531/I see you took Alvin in?
2120006532/I suppose not.
2120006533/And I take it you'll be his teacher.
2120006534/Doesn't he need a mother?
2120006535/Are you a chaplain of the Eternal Fire?
2120006536/Really?
2120006537/Is that so?
2120006538/You seem to contradict yourself.
2120006539/The Eternal Fire, no doubt.
2120006540/I apologize, Reverend.
2120006541/One more thing...
2120006542/I see you care for Alvin.
2120006543/I'll see you later.
2120006544/We'll see.
2120006545/I will, for 300 orens.
2120006546/I have ways of showing gratitude...
2120006547/Calm yourself, priest. I merely wish to speak with you.
2120006548/You're troubled by a Beast?
2120006549/Are they elders of some sort?
2120006550/No trust needed. Only a job.
2120006551/I carried the Eternal Fire to all the chapels.
2120006552/Perhaps. But I'd rather speak with her first.
2120006553/A witch? Maybe she can tell us more...
2120006554/I'm a witcher. I could help.
2120006555/Another witcher?
2120006556/Interesting.
2120006557/Who is this philanthropist?
2120006558/I have questions.
2120006559/Know anything about this Salamander prisoner?
2120006560/Finally, this absurdity is over.
2120006561/Hurry up, I don't have all day.
2120006562/I'll ask about it. Then I'll get the Professor.
2120006563/Connections, you mean. I'll find him.
2120006564/Watch my belongings. I'll be back and I'll want everything returned.
2120006565/Excellent. Well-fed monsters are slower.
2120006566/You didn't even give that tough guy a sword?
2120006567/Tell me about that Salamandra prisoner.
2120006568/Where is he?
2120006569/Thanks.
2120006570/You should drop that habit.
2120006571/Who did you confiscate the witcher's sword from?
2120006572/Before I went down the sewers... Somehow, I sense it was no coincidence. Where do I find Thaler?
2120006573/What's strong?
2120006574/I just...
2120006575/Why was the Professor released from prison?
2120006576/I should be like the city guards - release criminals whenever someone shakes a coin pouch?
2120006577/Who was this benefactor?
2120006578/He's just an old dwarf.
2120006579/I need to talk to him.
2120006580/Here's your coin.
2120006581/Got a cold?
2120006582/Damned thieves.
2120006583/Not so green I don't know the best way to take fisstech... Fold back your skin and rub...
2120006584/See you.
2120006585/Maybe I can persuade you...
2120006586/Where you can fold back your skin, Jethro.
2120006587/Can I talk to Vivaldi?
2120006588/The gate guards are giving me trouble.
2120006589/I'll return later.
2120006590/I'll check it out.
2120006591/If Foltest put a reward on the Professor's head, he must destest Salamandra...
2120006592/A parcel's missing from my belongings.
2120006593/Drawing from fire is dangerous. That's all I need to know.
2120006594/Don't digress, Kalkstein.
2120006595/That's hard to believe.
2120006596/I'm certain. You don't fool me with your scholarly guise.
2120006597/Someone went a long way to implicate you.
2120006598/Tell me about your magic abilities. Azar could probably use someone like you.
2120006599/What for?
2120006600/The wounded Salamander mentioned you.
2120006601/It's suspicious that people you hire are chased by Salamandra.
2120006602/I suspected you were working with Javed...
2120006603/I'll be back.
2120006604/You didn't try trapping him to hand him to Azar Javed?
2120006605/I don't know enough to decide. Let's drop the subject for now.
2120006606/Something I don't have evidence for yet.
2120006607/And as a theoretician, you have nothing Azar values. You've convinced me. I'm sorry I suspected you.
2120006608/An interesting story...
2120006609/I have new information on the tower.
2120006610/The mage lived there until he disappeared, most likely dead. He constructed clay golems that served him but hardly seemed a major achievement.
2120006611/One book contained hints of the stones whereabouts.
2120006612/Kalkstein, don't get worked up until I find the stones, which won't be easy. The information in these books is "murky" at best...
2120006613/The Sephirot are on the obelisks. The tower door is open.
2120006614/Thanks.
2120006615/Simple enough.
2120006616/What are the Sephirot?
2120006617/Those are the Sephirot?
2120006618/We'll discuss this another time.
2120006619/Tell me more.
2120006620/A princess up top, dragon below? Thanks, but I'll pass.
2120006621/In short, it breeds monsters?
2120006622/Where do I find it?
2120006623/And then it'll reassemble my being in your lab? Sure about this?
2120006624/I suppose he distilled the fifth essence and dusted the philosopher's stone?
2120006625/How's that?
2120006626/Who disappeared when he tried to enter the tower at your behest.
2120006627/Admit it. You hope to acquire real magic through your studies.
2120006628/I know Raymond is the Salamandra leader.
2120006629/Yes, I have irrefutable evidence. Azar killed Raymond and assumed his identity using an illusion.
2120006630/Forgive me, but how was I supposed to unlock the tower...?
2120006631/We'll see.
2120006632/Ahem.
2120006633/Enlighten me.
2120006634/What next?
2120006635/What next?
2120006636/We'll see.
2120006637/How do I get to the swamp?
2120006638/What then?
2120006639/The ferry goes both ways?
2120006640/Thanks.
2120006641/See you.
2120006642/Good luck.
2120006643/How do you know my name?
2120006644/What did you hear?
2120006645/We meet again.
2120006646/With what?
2120006647/That's what I'd like to know...
2120006648/Azar wanted me to think you worked for him.
2120006649/Why?
2120006650/The tower in the swamp.
2120006651/I heard Witcher Berengar was working for you...
2120006652/Care to elaborate?
2120006653/You hired him and he disappeared. Didn't you find that odd?
2120006654/What do you think happened?
2120006655/No, I have ghoul blood.
2120006656/Here it is.
2120006657/Not yet.
2120006658/There are ten corner stones involving the elements and threads of fate from which all this was born..
2120006659/I suppose I'm to find the others?
2120006660/Kalkstein...
2120006661/Tell me more about the Sephirot...
2120006662/Alchemists aren't alone. Many sorcerers are equally interested.
2120006663/What do the Sephirot represent?
2120006664/You had a job...
2120006665/So what's my job?
2120006666/I'll see what I can do, though I'm sure this won't be easy...
2120006667/Any specific titles in mind?
2120006668/I'll need to think this over.
2120006669/The wounded man was working for you.
2120006670/You're better off not knowing.
2120006671/Before this tower, the mage erected two others, but both collapsed. This one served as his house and lab.
2120006672/Let's talk about Salamandra.
2120006673/Vaska helped me locate the Tower tarot card. It describes how to wake the Sentry.
2120006674/A lightning rod?
2120006675/About the tower...
2120006676/Where can I find information on the tower?
2120006677/Let's summarize the facts.
2120006678/Here.
2120006679/Who's Herman the Mad?
2120006680/I'll think of something.
2120006681/I think you're in league with them.
2120006682/Anything else?
2120006683/All right, I'll do that.
2120006684/Yes, three fresh doses.
2120006685/Not yet, but I'll get you some soon.
2120006686/I believe you.
2120006687/I believe you.
2120006688/I don't believe you.
2120006689/I don't believe you.
2120006690/I believe you.
2120006691/I don't believe you.
2120006692/I think I've figured this out.
2120006693/Evidence indicates you're linked to the organization.
2120006694/I'm here about the notice.
2120006695/You live off the status quo. All your "associates" would eliminate you if you threatened the stability of their investments.
2120006696/How does this relate to Salamandra?
2120006697/Let's summarize the facts...
2120006698/Let's talk.
2120006699/I buried your friend.
2120006700/It was a decent burial. He got his own sarcophagus.
2120006701/Forgetting something?
2120006702/The dock has yet to be cleared of drowners.
2120006703/I'll visit the swamp as soon as possible.
2120006704/The dock is safe now.
2120006705/Thanks.
2120006706/What do you mean?
2120006707/I know you bribe the guards.
2120006708/How do you benefit?
2120006709/I see.
2120006710/I know you belong to a secret society.
2120006711/I've heard that before...
2120006712/We'll see about that.
2120006713/You paid to have the Professor released.
2120006714/Why not?
2120006715/I've nearly completed my investigation.
2120006716/I'll be back.
2120006717/Your business?
2120006718/Leuvaarden, I've heard so many high and mighty speeches that yours doesn't impress me. I don't give a shit about these forces. My only concern is reaching the Salamandra leaders and killing Azar Javed.
2120006719/That won't be easy. I may come see you again, and I'll be counting on your assistance.
2120006720/See you later.
2120006721/I'll give a good price.
2120006722/I didn't think it was worth so much, but all right.
2120006723/I don't have the money yet, but I'll bring it soon.
2120006724/I have 500 orens, though it's quite a price to pay for a stone...
2120006725/Positively. However, he's still an extremely powerful mage.
2120006726/Are you Leuvaarden?
2120006727/I heard creatures threaten the transport of goods.
2120006728/I'm hoping someone'll pay for their removal.
2120006729/What are the beasts like?
2120006730/A pleasure doing business.
2120006731/I can't take this job right now. We'll talk later.
2120006732/I suspect you know about Salamandra.
2120006733/We'll see.
2120006734/I know you sponsor illegal ventures.
2120006735/I know you support Salamandra.
2120006736/I don't have any definitive proof, so I'll let it lie - for now.
2120006737/If you don't work with Salamandra, who are you?
2120006738/Quit bluffing, Declan.
2120006739/Learn anything useful?
2120006740/I think you're paying for Salamander pins. I'm just not sure why you would do that.
2120006741/Why so defensive? I'm also after Salamandra and can prove it.
2120006742/I have three Salamander pins. Will you tell me about your secret society now?
2120006743/Great, but I still want to know why you're paying bounty hunters to track down bandits.
2120006744/I seek the Sephirot stones - I haven't yet located them all. I thought you might know such art and oddities.
2120006745/Then would you sell it to me?
2120006746/I can't wait on this.
2120006747/Who issued the warrant for the Professor's arrest?
2120006748/How's business?
2120006749/I see.
2120006750/Farewell.
2120006751/And you belong to a secret society.
2120006752/Why?
2120006753/Not all your money is clean.
2120006754/Spare me. You bribe guards to ignore your contraband.
2120006755/You're a thoroughbred merchant, Leuvaarden. So tied up in international business that you can't afford getting involved with a group of subversives.
2120006756/You finance illegal schemes...
2120006757/We need to talk about your dealings with Salamandra.
2120006758/I guess you're not the one I'm looking for.
2120006759/I don't believe you.
2120006760/I may have figured this out.
2120006761/I don't believe you.
2120006762/I guess that's believable.
2120006763/I don't believe you.
2120006764/I suppose not...
2120006765/Relax, I believe you.
2120006766/Javed's used an illusion to masquerade as Raymond. The real detective is dead.
2120006767/Shouldn't be a problem.
2120006768/I know the clock's ticking.
2120006769/Know what's going on with him?
2120006770/Tell me more about these monsters.
2120006771/What happened?
2120006772/Provided I agree, Yaren.
2120006773/Get along with the locals?
2120006774/Don't you fear working in such a dangerous area?
2120006775/Won't get anywhere that way.
2120006776/You want me to clear the road and get rid of the vodyanoi?
2120006777/Where do I find the fishpeople?
2120006778/The ferryman paid me for the herbs.
2120006779/I wade through mud, face danger, then we split the profit?
2120006780/I'm listening.
2120006781/I understand it's valuable.
2120006782/The brickmakers' eldress claims you can negotiate with the vodyanoi.
2120006783/It's worth it, if only to avoid revenge for the massacre you're asking for.
2120006784/Can we talk?
2120006785/And you...?
2120006786/I'll deliver the flowers to the ferryman as soon as I find them.
2120006787/Work for yourselves or someone else?
2120006788/Give me your axe. I'll take it as a sign of peace.
2120006789/Geralt the witcher, a friend.
2120006790/Godspeed.
2120006791/So nothing?
2120006792/Likewise, Yaren.
2120006793/I don't want any part of this business.
2120006794/You the chief lumberjack?
2120006795/Yaren...
2120006796/Right. I'll start collecting...
2120006797/Any jobs for a witcher?
2120006798/Here's your share.
2120006799/Okay, let's play herbalist.
2120006800/I'll take the axe to the fishpeople and return with their response.
2120006801/I took the risk in the swamp. I'm keeping all the gold.
2120006802/I'm still clearing the road to the landing.
2120006803/I've cleared the road to the landing. It's safe.
2120006804/About the road to the landing...
2120006805/I'll resolve this with my sword.
2120006806/Are you responsible for the logging?
2120006807/Do these trees have special value?
2120006808/I was supposed to collect beggartick blossoms.
2120006809/The vodyanoi accepted your sacrifice and gave an amulet in return. The fishpeople should leave you alone now.
2120006810/I see you keep a tight rein.
2120006811/I killed one at the altar. They'll get the message.
2120006812/Was there another witcher here before me? Berengar?
2120006813/Yaren...
2120006814/Tell me about the... brickmakers.
2120006815/How about monsters?
2120006816/Where will I find the druids?
2120006817/Then this must be my lucky day. Tell me about the swamp.
2120006818/Hmm.
2120006819/Anything else?
2120006820/Who lives here?
2120006821/What's with you?
2120006822/The tower?
2120006823/So where exactly to do they log?
2120006824/Where are the lumberjacks?
2120006825/Did I hear you mention mosquitoes?
2120006826/Mhm.
2120006827/Farewell.
2120006828/Greetings...
2120006829/Thanks for the polish...
2120006830/No thanks.
2120006831/You don't talk like a shoeshine.
2120006832/You could say that. Tell me about it.
2120006833/Anything worth seeing?
2120006834/Tell me more about the Order and the Squirrels.
2120006835/Just clean my boots.
2120006836/No thanks.
2120006837/Tell me about the plague.
2120006838/I'm interested in bandits, but not the ordinary kind..
2120006839/I'm looking for witcher's jobs.
2120006840/Greetings, who're you?
2120006841/I'm Geralt of Rivia.
2120006842/What was I supposed to do next?
2120006843/What's it like being a private eye?
2120006844/Can't you talk to the captain?
2120006845/See you soon.
2120006846/They've moved the prisoner to the hospital.
2120006847/They'll still be watching him.
2120006848/Guilty as hell.
2120006849/I don't have enough facts.
2120006850/Go on.
2120006851/The guards? At the city jail?
2120006852/All right, I'll check out those leads.
2120006853/I got a taste of his abilities... Anything else?
2120006854/I have some unfinished business.
2120006855/Is that all?
2120006856/I'll come back with the gold.
2120006857/I don't have the gold now, but maybe you'd care to share some information anyway?
2120006858/We'll see.
2120006859/No reason to get excited. He's out of our reach for now. Fighting the entire corps of city guards would be suicide.
2120006860/Shouldn't be hard - he has no desire to see me.
2120006861/I'll pay.
2120006862/Here's the gold. Why don't you tell me all you know about the Salamandra leader...
2120006863/Azar Javed. Name mean anything to you?
2120006864/Know anything more about the Salamandra prisoner?
2120006865/Didn't have time. Ramsmeat's men attacked.
2120006866/How do you want to proceed?
2120006867/I prefer hunting.
2120006868/I don't think I care to imagine...
2120006869/All right, I'll take care of it.
2120006870/The names mean nothing to me, but I'll assume that's a recommendation.
2120006871/I'm interested in the people who wear salamander pins.
2120006872/Don't worry about my eyesight. It's not Vincent.
2120006873/I'm looking for some information. Is this where I'll find it?
2120006874/I'll come back later.
2120006875/Personal matter or a commission?
2120006876/Count on it. People open up to me all the time.
2120006877/I hope he finds them.
2120006878/Who's working for Javed? Any guesses?
2120006879/Let's just say my boot's due a rendezvous with his ass.
2120006880/I'll think about it.
2120006881/I don't think so.
2120006882/I've heard enough.
2120006883/I think he's innocent.
2120006884/So, I got to the prisoner.
2120006885/One word: Kalkstein.
2120006886/So, I questioned the captain of the city guard.
2120006887/I've met Kalkstein. He didn't look the criminal...
2120006888/Javed might've scared him... or paid him off...
2120006889/Any suggestions?
2120006890/Surprise those who want to surprise you. I'll leave at midnight.
2120006891/Who? What happened?
2120006892/Relax, Raymond, you're safe now.
2120006893/What do we do?
2120006894/Who?
2120006895/What do you intend to do?
2120006896/You've done all right for yourself.
2120006897/Not so fast. She must be judged fairly...
2120006898/Mikul raped Ilsa, who took her own life.
2120006899/Go on.
2120006900/I have no choice but to believe you...
2120006901/You trade with bandits who kidnap children. I don't believe one word of what you say.
2120006902/Your brother was a warrior. You're nothing but a drunk. How could you have killed him... unless he was sleeping?
2120006903/I came across a doll that resembled you in her hut...
2120006904/What do you think, Reverend?
2120006905/You've convinced me.
2120006906/Shut up, you bastard. You lead this band of rogues, so you must know they sell children to the Salamanders, and you knew about the rape and murder. I spit on you. You're all the same, all guilty!
2120006907/I'm getting Abigail. Return to your homes.
2120006908/You're right, Reverend. I saw the doll in Odo's likeness, and the witch offered herself to me in exchange for a favor. You're right -- Abigail is guilty.
2120006909/Tell me.
2120006910/For 200 orens I could get...
2120006911/See you later.
2120006912/Really?
2120006913/This investigation is getting expensive...
2120006914/I couldn't conclude anything.
2120006915/Memorable.
2120006916/All the evidence suggests it. Clearly Ramsmeat got rid of a loose tongue, killed the man to silence him.
2120006917/...someone helped him along?
2120006918/I know how to handle monsters.
2120006919/How did that happen?
2120006920/Changes in the eyeballs. Typical of alchemical poisons.
2120006921/Not good.
2120006922/All right. Two hundred orens.
2120006923/Do we really need to do this autopsy?
2120006924/Mhm. Where can I find him?
2120006925/Wait a minute... Are you spying on me?
2120006926/I'm certain it was Kalkstein.
2120006927/I sure did.
2120006928/The liver was cirrhotic. The stab wounds were just a clumsy attempt to hide the real reason.
2120006929/How do I put this? Hmm... I mistook one vial for another and poured some caustic crap on the corpse. We couldn't draw any conclusions from what remained.
2120006930/Not a one. Come on, Raymond. Everyone makes mistakes...
2120006931/Raymond, I sense some gaps in your reasoning.
2120006932/How much do I owe you?
2120006933/I'm certain it was bandits, Ramsmeat's men.
2120006934/Hm.
2120006935/So what should I look for during the autopsy?
2120006936/I have the autopsy results.
2120006937/I've heard some really vile rumors about you...Something about girls...
2120006938/I wanted to take care of this alone, but if you're willing to help...
2120006939/It's summer...
2120006940/Yes... friends... Now, since we've defanged Javed by getting rid of Ramsmeat, let's play on what he and Kalkstein want so much.
2120006941/I found no proof on him... He was completely clean.
2120006942/You need time to cast a spell...
2120006943/He won't be bothering us anymore. But that's not it - we'll nab Javed soon. I have a plan. Your family will be avenged.
2120006944/Not a bit. Your masquerade is over, Javed. You're finished.
2120006945/We'll see...
2120006946/Recently, my medallion has vibrated every time I've come here.
2120006947/I'll be the one to face him if there's a confrontation. I need to prepare. Besides, you seem to have a better sense of the part...
2120006948/How come?
2120006949/Possibly...
2120006950/The thug, Ramsmeat.
2120006951/There's a box of fisstech on your desk... You a user?
2120006952/I hear he hates humans...
2120006953/Raymond. You killed him, just as you had his family murdered before. Then, as the detective, you tried to sick me on your enemies.
2120006954/Game over. I found Raymond's body. Surrender, Javed...
2120006955/The banker, Vivaldi.
2120006956/Ready. Javed? You're clever, that's undeniable, but you made one serious mistake.
2120006957/Everyone knows... but few care...
2120006958/Hmmmm.
2120006959/That's not my only concern.
2120006960/It's you. I have the impression you've changed...
2120006961/I find your reasoning somewhat flawed.
2120006962/The alchemist, Kalkstein.
2120006963/Many before you thought the same but I'm still alive. Still on your trail...
2120006964/Captain Vincent.
2120006965/So, I killed Ramsmeat.
2120006966/I'm not ready to do that.
2120006967/Mhm.
2120006968/Never mind.
2120006969/Kalkstein. He's perfect.
2120006970/Hmm... This might be a bit far fetched...
2120006971/What will you do when I finally find you? Will you fight or flee to Zerrikania...?
2120006972/Who would you pretend to be? Must be someone with numerous contacts... Someone who can show up in strange places without raising suspicions... Who would be the ideal victim, for surely you had to kill this individual?
2120006973/There is one thing that worries me. I know you've found a way to move freely around town...
2120006974/I have a suspect...
2120006975/I need to think about it. I'll let you know once I've figured something out.
2120006976/It vibrates a lot.
2120006977/The fence, Thaler.
2120006978/The autopsy proved you killed our witness... Azar. Surrender.
2120006979/The merchant, Leuvaarden.
2120006980/We all do.
2120006981/We'll see.
2120006982/Right.
2120006983/You're a suspect.||I have an idea. You pretend to be Javed. Let's try to understand him, predict his next move...
2120006984/I wanted to ask you about the commander of the Royal Guards...
2120006985/Why the world map on your wall? Developed an interest in international politics?
2120006986/But if he's taking bribes from Salamandra...
2120006987/I see you've planned everything...
2120006988/I know how to handle monsters.
2120006989/Good news. You'll be happy... Raymond.
2120006990/And there's your mistake: pride. You think yourself clever enough to trick a witcher... but you miscalculated. I know who you're impersonating.
2120006991/We'll speak later.
2120006992/What number is he on your list of suspects?
2120006993/I am a client, and I think you're really interested in the Redania-Temeria border. You've marked it with pins.
2120006994/Hm.
2120006995/Won't be easy, but I'll try.
2120006996/I'm ready for Ramsmeat.
2120006997/What do we do with that information?
2120006998/All right.
2120006999/Come with me to the swamp, and when I open the tower, take the secret books, hide them away for me. We can't let them fall into Javed's hands.
2120007000/I was supposed to tend to Ramsmeat.
2120007001/You mean all those strange things you supposedly do...
2120007002/The secrets inside the swamp tower. I know how to open it, and I'd like you to do something.
2120007003/Lovely rugs, must've cost a bundle. Earlier on your place was more... well... homey.
2120007004/It's warm in here. You didn't used to burn such big logs.
2120007005/Now.
2120007006/I know I pay you a bundle and you have other cases, but aren't they a bit... flamboyant?
2120007007/Maybe later. I need to make sure of something.
2120007008/Something's been worrying me...
2120007009/How do we handle this?
2120007010/Just one thing missing - I have yet to unlock the tower door.
2120007011/Let's say I do.
2120007012/Of course not.
2120007013/I'd rather stay focused. Should I get the book from the tower?
2120007014/I think I made sure of that.
2120007015/I'd prefer a monster anatomy lesson.
2120007016/Shani, I do other things besides kill...
2120007017/Easy to find?
2120007018/Here's the celandine.
2120007019/I'll try to help.
2120007020/No, thanks.
2120007021/Maybe later.
2120007022/I need to talk to you...
2120007023/I wanted to talk.
2120007024/I'd like to question this man.
2120007025/Hmm... I see you're working at the hospital...
2120007026/Who injured him?
2120007027/I'll try.
2120007028/A little.
2120007029/All right. I'll come back later.
2120007030/Okay.
2120007031/It was nothing.
2120007032/I wanted to question a prisoner, one of your patients, but thugs interrupted us. It was their bodies the guard discovered later.
2120007033/Thanks, Shani, for understanding.
2120007034/When can we talk?
2120007035/Hi, Shani.
2120007036/I did, though it wasn't easy.
2120007037/What is it?
2120007038/Where are you staying?
2120007039/See you.
2120007040/You need those plants?
2120007041/You could always go back.
2120007042/Don't recall.
2120007043/It's necessary.
2120007044/How can I help?
2120007045/Well, I suppose...
2120007046/I saw guards...
2120007047/I need you to help me with an autopsy.
2120007048/Let's get started.
2120007049/Some kind of fit?
2120007050/What do you think?
2120007051/They say successful autopsies are based on curiosity. Should we look?
2120007052/What do you think it means?
2120007053/External signs aren't everything... His neck muscles and palms look tense. How do you know when he died?
2120007054/Poison maybe? But then why would someone stab him?
2120007055/The bone marrow has been sucked out. Must be scavengers.
2120007056/Any suggestions?
2120007057/A werewolf?
2120007058/Could a human have inflicted these wounds?
2120007059/So he was torn to pieces after he died. I'm interested in the cause of death.
2120007060/I guess...
2120007061/An assassin's dagger... Ramsmeat's men.
2120007062/Something's wrong. His head's in an unnatural position, his hands twisted...
2120007063/Shani, this isn't a lecture hall...
2120007064/Look at the heart.
2120007065/Let's look at the liver.
2120007066/Let's look at the lungs...
2120007067/Everything so far points to Ramsmeat's men.
2120007068/Kalkstein also deals in such things.
2120007069/Whatever you say.
2120007070/Okay...
2120007071/Poison?
2120007072/Was it fatal?
2120007073/Can you survive pneumothorax?
2120007074/You mean the wounds weren't the cause of death?
2120007075/Could bandits have obtained such poison?
2120007076/Check the liver.
2120007077/Let's see the lungs.
2120007078/You choose.
2120007079/Let's look at the heart.
2120007080/So the heart stopped beating long before?
2120007081/I need proof.
2120007082/For an alchemist?
2120007083/Those wounds are too obvious. I suspect something more. Poison?
2120007084/Are you certain poison is the only explanation for the unusual rigor mortis?
2120007085/This is too easy...
2120007086/I have a sinking feeling there's more to this.
2120007087/Then let's check for those.
2120007088/Kalkstein?
2120007089/Any way to confirm that?
2120007090/A clear message to those who say too much.
2120007091/Yes. Really subtle, Ramsmeat's style. He didn't realize a corpse could say so much. Thanks, that's the evidence I needed.
2120007092/And my payment...?
2120007093/I've enough strength for the two of you...
2120007094/It's dead.
2120007095/This is your second chance. Use it wisely.
2120007096/NOT_USED
2120007097/Handing the children to Salamandra was dishonorable, Reverend.
2120007098/After all you've done, I'll take it from your dead body!
2120007099/Justice will be served.
2120007100/NOT_USED
2120007101/You handed the children to Salamandra. I won't forget that.
2120007102/Blackened?
2120007103/So we're certain a gifted alchemist is the murderer.
2120007104/Kalkstein. He wanted to implicate the bandits but he failed to foresee a professional autopsy. Thanks, Shani, that's the evidence I needed.
2120007105/Azar's using an illusion - trying to manipulate me. Thanks, Shani. I couldn't have figured it out without you.
2120007106/Where did you get it?
2120007107/Our climate is too cold and dry for the Tsetse fly. Even if someone brought eggs how would they get up his nose?
2120007108/Raymond...
2120007109/My medallion vibrates whenever I see him, lately. And Zerrikania... that's where Azar Javed is from. The real Raymond may no longer be with us...
2120007110/He added eggs to the fisstech, then came here at night to fake the other evidence.
2120007111/Larvae of the Zerrikanian Tsetse fly.
2120007112/It's part of their development cycle. If we were in Zerrikania, I'd say a fly crawled up his nose and laid its eggs.
2120007113/I'll talk to Kalkstein first. He should help me prepare.
2120007114/Tiny, white, like flour...
2120007115/If you need help...
2120007116/Who do you mean?
2120007117/What is it?
2120007118/I'll visit soon.
2120007119/I'll visit soon.
2120007120/I wanted to question a prisoner, one of your patients, but thugs interrupted us. It was their bodies the guard discovered later.
2120007121/I'm sorry...
2120007122/Thanks, Shani.
2120007123/A pretty, young medic like you can't be lacking admirers...
2120007124/I'll sniff around.
2120007125/I'm glad.
2120007126/Who were they?
2120007127/I have some celandine for you.
2120007128/No problem.
2120007129/You need any help?
2120007130/I'm listening.
2120007131/I'll try.
2120007132/Lacking the drinks?
2120007133/I don't have time, maybe later.
2120007134/For luck.
2120007135/See you at the party!
2120007136/I need your help with an autopsy...
2120007137/Since I started investigating Salamandra.
2120007138/Knew?
2120007139/Shani, I wanted to ask you something...
2120007140/I didn't want to disturb you.
2120007141/Looks like it.
2120007142/That nice lady downstairs?
2120007143/Girls your age should be married.
2120007144/Is your rent low at least?
2120007145/Shani, I...
2120007146/You stayed.
2120007147/Bye.
2120007148/Old people are like that.
2120007149/Bye.
2120007150/Easy to find?
2120007151/No problem.
2120007152/How'd it end?
2120007153/Were they wearing Salamander badges?
2120007154/A gathering?
2120007155/What do you need?
2120007156/I brought some liquor.
2120007157/About the gift...
2120007158/I'm glad.
2120007159/I heard you saw Cöen shortly before he died.
2120007160/Anyway...
2120007161/I found his sword...
2120007162/You were a medic at Brenna?
2120007163/Sorry, Shani... I didn't know him. Do you know anything about this sword?
2120007164/I remember, Shani.
2120007165/You said you'd stay in Vizima.
2120007166/Old hag... should've died years ago.
2120007167/But...
2120007168/It does.
2120007169/Speaking of Oxenfurt, what did Dandelion actually interrupt?
2120007170/Have you gotten over it?
2120007171/How do I find information to help the autopsy?
2120007172/Farewell.
2120007173/Where do you live?
2120007174/Sorry, let's talk another time.
2120007175/What is it?
2120007176/Don't mention it.
2120007177/You're blushing...
2120007178/What about this party?
2120007179/Not really...
2120007180/Shani...
2120007181/Javed is using an illusion to disguise himself as Raymond. The real detective is dead. I have solid proof. Javed's now free to pursue his plans. He wanted me to go after Vincent, Ramsmeat and Kalkstein...
2120007182/Amphibians.
2120007183/Can you get me inside the cemetery?
2120007184/I've figured out Javed.
2120007185/You ignore it. Just more prizes to peddle. You're an insignificant fence, nothing more.
2120007186/You're no criminal genius, Thaler, though you might like to be.
2120007187/A little conniver who buys debts to feel important, to have power over people if only for a moment.
2120007188/I'll stop short of gutting you.
2120007189/Care to play?
2120007190/How did you get Berengar's effects?
2120007191/You're not worth my time.
2120007192/But why at night?
2120007193/I've figured out Salamandra.
2120007194/How can I convince you?
2120007195/Other property?!
2120007196/So where did you get the sword?
2120007197/Have you heard of Salamandra?
2120007198/Innocent until proven guilty, I guess, so let's assume it's not you for now.
2120007199/I need to weaken him. Unfortunately, I don't know how.
2120007200/How did you get Berengar's property?
2120007201/You support them with your contacts and resources.
2120007202/You gamble?
2120007203/Thanks.
2120007204/Right...
2120007205/You're clean. I have proof you're not working for Azar.
2120007206/Another witcher, Berengar, came to see you.
2120007207/I'll find you later.
2120007208/You don't get it. I'm not interested in the middleman. I want information about Berengar!
2120007209/Though a lot of evidence pointed toward you. Almost as if someone was framing you...
2120007210/So you say.
2120007211/The city guards found a witcher's sword at your place.
2120007212/Care to describe him?
2120007213/Try me.
2120007214/A lot of shadowy people hang around here.
2120007215/We'll see. Later.
2120007216/I'll be back.
2120007217/Let me draw you a picture: A certain organization -- Salamandra -- has it in for witchers. A witcher -- Berengar -- disappears, and all he had lands in the hands of a fence -- you... Getting this?
2120007218/Salamanders are amphibians. Now tell me your connection to them.
2120007219/You have contacts among the city guards... could be valuable to Azar.
2120007220/How do you know that?
2120007221/You do business with Salamandra?
2120007222/I know about your tryst with Shani...
2120007223/Many do.
2120007224/Take care?
2120007225/Where do I find him?
2120007226/Explain to me why the guards tolerate you.
2120007227/Stop pretending you have principles. You come across the property of a witcher, someone who risks his life for people like you, and what do you do?
2120007228/You talk a bundle, but when push comes to shove, you hide under the city guards' bibs. You lack balls...
2120007229/Let's summarize...
2120007230/There's nothing to this story.
2120007231/What you deal in?
2120007232/I may have just figured this out.
2120007233/Hm, believable, I guess...
2120007234/I don't believe you.
2120007235/That's believable...
2120007236/I don't believe you.
2120007237/I suppose that could be true...
2120007238/Unconvincing...
2120007239/Hmm...
2120007240/What about the guard?
2120007241/I'll ask around.
2120007242/Whatever you say.
2120007243/I wish to learn about the swamp tower.
2120007244/I'm still working on the drowners that haunt your pits.
2120007245/I'm listening.
2120007246/Geralt, witcher. What do the villagers do?
2120007247/What shall I call you?
2120007248/Do you have monster problems?
2120007249/Too much risk for such a measly reward.
2120007250/That's enough. Where are they?
2120007251/I'm not interested in that. I'll do it for payment.
2120007252/Don't get anxious. You'll be back to normal in no time.
2120007253/It's profitable?
2120007254/What do you do here?
2120007255/Who are these Lords?
2120007256/Farewell.
2120007257/We solve problems.
2120007258/Drowners. I can finish them.
2120007259/I see none working.
2120007260/I keep thinking of the fishpeople, vodyanoi.
2120007261/What are they like?
2120007262/I've killed the drowners.
2120007263/Maybe you should move.
2120007264/Not me. Farewell.
2120007265/Do what you will.
2120007266/Has another witcher been here - Berengar?
2120007267/You don't find this place dull?
2120007268/Who was she?
2120007269/A fairy-tale beginning...
2120007270/Seems I need to find this card. Would you know where?
2120007271/And?
2120007272/Thanks, Vaska.
2120007273/One of them is the guard?
2120007274/Maybe we can play some time.
2120007275/Kalkstein, an alchemist, claims you know about the mage from the tower and the guard.
2120007276/Will do.
2120007277/I'll ask around.
2120007278/I looked everywhere but no.
2120007279/I'll keep looking.
2120007280/What else do you leave?
2120007281/Life in the swamp must be dull.
2120007282/And?
2120007283/Why do you place items on the altar?
2120007284/Why do you worship the fishpeople?
2120007285/What about the guard?
2120007286/Farewell.
2120007287/Let's discuss a job.
2120007288/Not me. Farewell.
2120007289/Kalkstein, an alchemist, claims you know about the tower's mage and its sentry.
2120007290/Okay...
2120007291/Let's talk later.
2120007292/A fairy-tale beginning...
2120007293/Was another witcher here, Berengar?
2120007294/All right, I'll look for the boy.
2120007295/We should play some time.
2120007296/I'd like to learn about the tower in the swamp.
2120007297/Perhaps water beasts ate him?
2120007298/The tree fellers grow uneasy about the vodyanoi.
2120007299/The fishpeople can't be innocent if they brainwashed you. I think those fishpeople will need to be wiped out.
2120007300/Thanks, Vaska.
2120007301/I'll negotiate with them, but I'll need your help.
2120007302/Prepare for what?
2120007303/The lumberjacks think the Water Lords threaten them.
2120007304/Who was the woman?
2120007305/The druids didn't take your boy. If I find him, I'll see to his safe return.
2120007306/I'm listening.
2120007307/I'll be careful.
2120007308/What else?
2120007309/Seems I need to find this card. Would you know where?
2120007310/One of them is the guard?
2120007311/Where's the altar?
2120007312/How do I communicate with vodyanoi?
2120007313/Sorry.
2120007314/What kind of god is he?
2120007315/Yes, I wish to believe.
2120007316/I'm still looking for the missing kid.
2120007317/I'll be careful.
2120007318/Which creep?
2120007319/Woudn't surprise me.
2120007320/Where...?
2120007321/Pardon? What about half the kingdom, the princess' hand in marriage?
2120007322/That tub of lard? You're kidding.
2120007323/I'll slay the monster.
2120007324/I'm almost proud.
2120007325/I'm the better candidate.
2120007326/Piece of cake.
2120007327/Can I have it?
2120007328/I'm truly honored.
2120007329/I need a weapon.
2120007330/I'll see what I can do.
2120007331/Fine.
2120007332/What do you do nights? Meet your boss, Azar Javed?
2120007333/I know about your connection to Salamandra.
2120007334/You've stopped your men pursuing Salamandra.
2120007335/Thanks.
2120007336/Someone informed them about my cockatrice contract.
2120007337/The warehouses... You don't intend to go there alone?
2120007338/I see.
2120007339/It's Raymond!
2120007340/What does the full moon have to do with it?
2120007341/But you can bend the law.
2120007342/That's the last time you use me. I'm not a general avenger...
2120007343/I'll see...
2120007344/I can prove I killed the cockatrice.
2120007345/I killed the archespore in the swamp. I have proof.
2120007346/See you.
2120007347/Do you handle monsters, too?
2120007348/What pays best?
2120007349/I have irrefutable evidence you're not involved.
2120007350/I won't disturb you, then.
2120007351/You're corrupt. Azar Javed bought you with gold...
2120007352/Where do you get gold for that?
2120007353/I wanted to talk to you about Salamandra.
2120007354/I get it - observe the law at all costs.
2120007355/How's the Salamandra investigation going?
2120007356/But...
2120007357/I've got no real proof, so I'll have to wait to decide.
2120007358/The Salamandra boss.
2120007359/Don't have a choice.
2120007360/Thanks. Know anything else about Salamandra?
2120007361/I've a letter signed by Yaevinn, leader of a band of Squirrels. Might interest the authorities.
2120007362/Absolutely nothing. Forget about it.
2120007363/Ever heard this? If you want something done well, do it yourself?
2120007364/Many problems in town?
2120007365/See it as a way to prove your innocence...
2120007366/Steady!
2120007367/They say you're holding a Salamander prisoner.
2120007368/Right.
2120007369/We'll talk later.
2120007370/Unconvincing.
2120007371/Deduction - the detective's most reliable instrument...
2120007372/Meaning?
2120007373/Get to the point, Vincent...
2120007374/Wealthy friends...
2120007375/I'll continue the investigation on my own. If you're involved in any way...
2120007376/Vincent...
2120007377/The Professor... after you released him...
2120007378/No doubt...
2120007379/Here.
2120007380/Well...
2120007381/Talk to me...
2120007382/Quickly.
2120007383/You intend to deal with Salamandra?
2120007384/You ever do autopsies?
2120007385/True.
2120007386/Didn't I hear you say that everyone's equal...?
2120007387/You must be kidding.
2120007388/Several possibilities, mostly pointing at you.
2120007389/Salamandra killed the real Raymond. Javed has used Raymond's good name to pursue his goals while concealed behind a magical illusion...
2120007390/You let the Professor out of prison!
2120007391/Acknowledging your reasons.
2120007392/Well, I wouldn't mind knowing...
2120007393/Any way I can help?
2120007394/To keep your investigation intact you kept it secret. Your nightly dealings are not my business.
2120007395/Can you get me a pass into the cemetery?
2120007396/I'll summarize...
2120007397/My encounter with Salamandra was the Professor's doing. You were forced to release him.
2120007398/I think I have this figured out.
2120007399/I insist. Just give me a price...
2120007400/I don't believe you ever supported Salamandra.
2120007401/I have several suspects, not only dwarves.
2120007402/So why talk to them?
2120007403/You're sponsoring Javed, Vivaldi.
2120007404/Sorry I suspected you. I know you've lost control of your bank.
2120007405/Why do you deal with the Scoia'tael?
2120007406/Do I?
2120007407/Has your resentment toward Vizimans led you to a life of crime?
2120007408/The Professor's bail money came from your bank.
2120007409/I've figured out Azar Javed's contacts.
2120007410/I'll be back.
2120007411/I'm looking for the leader of a certain organization.
2120007412/But...
2120007413/Nothing but a pile of suspicions. I have to assume you're clean for now.
2120007414/The Professor's bail was paid through your bank.
2120007415/I know beneath that mask of a sour cynic, you're a law-abiding dwarf, taught respect by his forebears.
2120007416/Do you have a copy of "The Secret Gates"?
2120007417/A lucky dwarf.
2120007418/Greetings, dwarf.
2120007419/Any time.
2120007420/I want to discuss Salamandra.
2120007421/But you...
2120007422/She-dwarves?
2120007423/I neither live in Vizima, nor am I a human.
2120007424/I'm Geralt - and I'm no debt collector.
2120007425/I've got my eye on you.
2120007426/What do you want me to call you?
2120007427/Let's hope you're right.
2120007428/Even the smallest details sometimes are.
2120007429/Have you finished your answer to Yaevinn?
2120007430/How's business?
2120007431/I have a message for you from Yaevinn.
2120007432/Brilliant response.
2120007433/Gold?
2120007434/And with humans?
2120007435/Power?
2120007436/Agreed.
2120007437/A witcher. A mutant.
2120007438/I hope you recover your assets.
2120007439/Your choice.
2120007440/Goodbye.
2120007441/A dwarf who believes in justice and is trying to fit into human society.
2120007442/How much?
2120007443/You deal with the Scoia'tael.
2120007444/I know it's Raymond!
2120007445/You have good reason to dislike humans...
2120007446/...The real detective is dead. Azar Javed is using a magic illusion.
2120007447/Let's summarize...
2120007448/I don't believe you.
2120007449/I don't believe you.
2120007450/I don't believe you.
2120007451/I believe you.
2120007452/I believe you.
2120007453/I believe you.
2120007454/I may have this figured out.
2120007455/By chance...
2120007456/Beer.
2120007457/Forgive me, your beauty rendered me speechless.
2120007458/Sometimes.
2120007459/Nothing now, but care to sit down with me for a moment?
2120007460/Don't be angry. Only a blind man could ignore you.
2120007461/You mean to say you stop being decent after work?
2120007462/In that case, I'll have a beer, please.
2120007463/Nothing now. I'll see you later.
2120007464/How much do you collect for a drowner?
2120007465/What was that?
2120007466/How much for each?
2120007467/I've never come close to that. I knew something was wrong with those prices.
2120007468/Greetings.
2120007469/Take care.
2120007470/What does the creature from the crypt look like?
2120007471/Progress wherever you look, only witchers, the relics they are, still work for a pittance... while being called freaks by those they do favors for.
2120007472/I have the head of the lakeshore monster.
2120007473/I'm looking for witchers' work.
2120007474/Come on, we're in the same profession.
2120007475/Did the peasants say anything more about the lakeshore monster?
2120007476/I killed the beast from the crypt.
2120007477/So, how much for a drowner?
2120007478/You judge me poorly, Yaevinn.
2120007479/Well, he has disappeared. Any idea where he might be?
2120007480/I'm not sure I'm understanding this...
2120007481/I'm no courier.
2120007482/Has another witcher been here - Berengar?
2120007483/Ooh, an elven psychoanalyst.
2120007484/No one. I'm asking all swamp dwellers.
2120007485/What can you tell me about your kind? What makes you elves tick?
2120007486/Who's the letter to?
2120007487/I'll do it, I'm going to Vizima anyway.
2120007488/Greetings.
2120007489/See you later.
2120007490/I'm looking for witchers' work.
2120007491/A sharp wit. I'm Geralt.
2120007492/Let's talk.
2120007493/Decades? Live that long among humans, you're bound to become more like them than you ever wanted to be.
2120007494/One more word about my accepting my otherness and finding the home I never had and I'll cry like a baby.
2120007495/Nice and to the point. Farewell.
2120007496/I'm interested in a Tarot card that belonged to the mage of this swamp.
2120007497/I'm listening.
2120007498/Got more work for me?
2120007499/NOT_USED
2120007500/NOT_USED
2120007501/So he isn't dead. But why did he hide his gear?
2120007502/I hope I'll be far away when it begins.
2120007503/An uprising against humans? What if I inform the authorities?
2120007504/Vivaldi's gone bankrupt.
2120007505/Farewell.
2120007506/We'll see.
2120007507/My own.
2120007508/What are you preparing for?
2120007509/Your side. I feel a connection with other freaks who can't be trusted.
2120007510/I don't have time now. Farewell.
2120007511/Time will tell.
2120007512/You've been busy. A training camp?
2120007513/So my effort was in vain?
2120007514/I have Vivaldi's response.
2120007515/Yaevinn, I didn't deliver your letter...
2120007516/I led the unit to the burial ground and we, uh, encountered some knights of the Order...
2120007517/What circumstances?
2120007518/NOT_USED
2120007519/NOT_USED
2120007520/NOT_USED
2120007521/Are the knights a serious threat?
2120007522/Yes, they'll be useful.
2120007523/NOT_USED
2120007524/Thank you, Yaevinn.
2120007525/NOT_USED
2120007526/Actually... everyone, apart from me.
2120007527/Really think this band of warriors can accomplish something?
2120007528/NOT_USED
2120007529/I led the unit to the burial ground and we ran into some knights of the Order...
2120007530/All jests aside, as King Dezmod said when his guests began turning blue and dying. That's all I have to say about Vivaldi.
2120007531/No.
2120007532/But we found neither hawkers nor weapons.
2120007533/Hm...
2120007534/I suppose he advocates peaceful reform, struggle within the limits of the law.
2120007535/What's it to do with me?
2120007536/That's my business, Yaevinn.
2120007537/I'm not sure I want to get involved. I need some time to consider.
2120007538/All right, I'll help, but tell me who the hav'caaren are.
2120007539/Yaevinn, I know I agreed to lead your unit, but...
2120007540/Yaevinn, I'm a witcher. I was created to protect humans from monsters, whether they have tentacles and scales or walk around on two feet giving lofty speeches.
2120007541/I'm sure I will.
2120007542/Learn anything?
2120007543/NOT_USED
2120007544/Relax, I just need some time to prepare.
2120007545/Care for a game?
2120007546/Whenever.
2120007547/I'll find you later.
2120007548/That's slow?
2120007549/How's life?
2120007550/Anyone play dice here?
2120007551/Shani insisted your knowledge of weapons is unequalled.
2120007552/Go on.
2120007553/Know anything about Vivaldi's bank?
2120007554/What do you know about my silver sword?
2120007555/Beautiful analogy. Thanks.
2120007556/I suggest we drink heavily. If that doesn't help...
2120007557/I wouldn't dare.
2120007558/How so?
2120007559/Zoltan Chivay. Good to see you.
2120007560/I'm not so sure.
2120007561/All right, I understand. Thanks.
2120007562/Care to drop in on Shani's party?
2120007563/This might get interesting.
2120007564/I'm not persuaded, but thanks. Farewell.
2120007565/I warn you, some philosophy's involved...
2120007566/Who should I talk to about ridding them of the danger?
2120007567/Thanks Zoltan.
2120007568/Got a minute?
2120007569/The Evil that witchers fight stems from chaos, from actions aimed at disturbing order. For where Evil spreads, Order cannot be established. Instead of the light of wisdom, the glimmer of hope and the glow of warmth, darkness ensues. And in darkness you find nothing but blood, fangs and claws... like in the outskirts.
2120007570/And a professional is...?
2120007571/The right of witchers to live and function in this world has fallen out of balance, because the struggle between Good and Evil now plays out on a different battlefield with different rules. Evil has ceased being chaotic. No longer a blind, elemental power, Evil follows rules according to the rights it's been granted. It functions in line with treaties...
2120007572/I need to beat four professionals. Breeze.
2120007573/Yeah. See you there.
2120007574/Who's the richest person in Vizima's Temple Quarter?
2120007575/That means nothing.
2120007576/I understand. Thanks.
2120007577/Where do I find these famed Viziman poker players?
2120007578/I'm not interested.
2120007579/Thanks, Zoltan.
2120007580/How are you doing?
2120007581/I'm looking for work.
2120007582/Thanks.
2120007583/They weren't so tough.
2120007584/Nothing, actually.
2120007585/Farewell.
2120007586/My profession's not exactly conducive to marriage. Infertility, incessant risk, travel. Not many women would agree to that.
2120007587/True enough. Listen, Zoltan. I wanted to talk to you.
2120007588/That explains a lot.
2120007589/It seems so. How did you manage to get in?
2120007590/Shit or no shit, witchers exist to slay monsters. How can I when the real monsters hide behind ideals, faith or the law...?
2120007591/I've won a few poker rounds already.
2120007592/I've played a few professionals.
2120007593/I'm Geralt.
2120007594/I suppose fairies funded your armor and castles.
2120007595/Let's talk.
2120007596/What prompted you to enter the sewers after a beast?
2120007597/Wait... that's witchers' work.
2120007598/If you don't mind, I have some work to do down here and I'd like to get it done fast.
2120007599/Think you can kill the cockatrice?
2120007600/Anything useful to be taken from the carcass?
2120007601/My sympathies. Did you hunt the manticore, too?
2120007602/Impressive knowledge.
2120007603/And your sarcasm...
2120007604/So how would you say the beast can be killed?
2120007605/Go on...
2120007606/What do you know about cockatrices?
2120007607/No thanks. I work alone.
2120007608/Agreed. Let's go.
2120007609/Spare me your scientific babble.
2120007610/A heroic death...
2120007611/Indeed.
2120007612/Skip the medical exam.
2120007613/You did well, Siegfried. Glad we met. I need to recover my things.
2120007614/Where are you headed?
2120007615/The captain of the guard, the loon from the jail, and the prisoners. I fought the cockatrice for my freedom.
2120007616/Farewell. And thanks.
2120007617/Ah, your sacred mission of protecting humankind?
2120007618/Thanks. I'd rather not go back the way I came.
2120007619/Let's get out of here.
2120007620/You could say so. The thugs with the salamander sign have been bothering me for a while.
2120007621/Will you show me the mill?
2120007622/Ladies first.
2120007623/I forgot.
2120007624/Don't worry. We witchers have solutions for that...
2120007625/All right, I'll come back with the wine.
2120007626/Very well, though it reeks.
2120007627/Good advice. Know the way out?
2120007628/Lead the way.
2120007629/I don't think I can go back the way I came.
2120007630/I'm a witcher. I've been slaying monsters since childhood.
2120007631/Hmmm, I hadn't really thought about it. I'm here about the notice.
2120007632/Here are their tongues.
2120007633/I've heard enough...
2120007634/Sounds like witchers' work. Anyone willing to pay to have it done?
2120007635/Hmm, no, I'm not interested.
2120007636/In the evening. Come if you feel like it.
2120007637/Not today. Heard of any witcher jobs?
2120007638/I'm not sure I'm interested.
2120007639/All right.
2120007640/No, thanks.
2120007641/Thanks, Siegfried. I'll give it a try.
2120007642/Not now, Siegfried. Listen, Shani is throwing a little party...
2120007643/However?
2120007644/Uh, never mind.
2120007645/Well...
2120007646/No, not yet.
2120007647/To the Dike.
2120007648/Why?
2120007649/Thanks, Siegfried.
2120007650/What are you doing here?
2120007651/Sorry.
2120007652/True, the plague must be afraid of me. Thanks, Siegfried.
2120007653/See you.
2120007654/Yes, here are their tongues.
2120007655/So Berengar is alive... This is getting interesting. Thank you, Siegfried.
2120007656/And?
2120007657/Wait here. I'll look around.
2120007658/No, I haven't gotten around to it.
2120007659/I don't doubt that.
2120007660/Berengar!
2120007661/All right, I'll lead your knights.
2120007662/I led the knights to the burial ground. There was a fight...
2120007663/It was an ambush. There were no hawkers and the elves were waiting. I'm sorry it turned out this way.
2120007664/Now it's an elven burial ground. Your knights fought well. There were no hawkers, though. The Squirrels ambushed us.
2120007665/Your men are dead. I'm sorry.
2120007666/I'm here about the notice.
2120007667/I'm a witcher, not a soldier.
2120007668/What happened?
2120007669/Don't get excited, Siegfried.
2120007670/Guess the hydra got a reprieve.
2120007671/You should get someone to dress that wound...
2120007672/So, I led your knights to the Golem Burial Ground.
2120007673/I need to prepare.
2120007674/Of course. One more thing: who are these hawkers?
2120007675/You want me to take command? Are you sure none of your knights will object?
2120007676/Quiet... I hear footsteps.
2120007677/I'm looking for work. Know who could help?
2120007678/Farewell.
2120007679/Thanks, that's a big help..
2120007680/I hear you buy jewelry.
2120007681/I want to sell a badge.
2120007682/Drink with me?
2120007683/Deal.
2120007684/Another time.
2120007685/I'll come back.
2120007686/Tell me who's paying for Salamander badges or your own mother won't recognize you.
2120007687/100 orens - tell me who's paying for Salamander badges.
2120007688/Magic, surely...
2120007689/I'm not sure I understand.
2120007690/I'll do that.
2120007691/I can't say.
2120007692/He seems clever enough. Surely someone will want him.
2120007693/I'm seeking men who wear the sign of the salamander. Seen anyone like that in the area?
2120007694/Were we friends?
2120007695/Where's Alvin?
2120007696/So, what'll become of Alvin?
2120007697/We'll speak later.
2120007698/I'll look in on them.
2120007699/When are you leaving?
2120007700/Unfortunately, I lost my memory. I recall the last few weeks, nothing more.
2120007701/Do we know each other?
2120007702/It's not that bad. I'm actually getting used to it.
2120007703/Dandelion?
2120007704/It's been a long time since I've heard mention of Salamandra. Do you know anything about them?
2120007705/Someone might pay to have the Beast slain...
2120007706/Wait a minute. I ran into wild dogs on my way here, but they were nothing like these, and I don't mean just the green fur... Know anything about them?
2120007707/A lamia?
2120007708/Thanks. I may stay longer than I planned.
2120007709/They killed someone I was fond of... and stole something of mine.
2120007710/It seems he saved us from the Beast...
2120007711/What brings you to this village?
2120007712/Hey!
2120007713/You want a thrashing?
2120007714/Shove off.
2120007715/What the hell...?
2120007716/What is this crap?
2120007717/...you want to hire a stranger to retrieve them? You're kidding, right?
2120007718/What is it?
2120007719/Fine. And I keep everything but the family ring?
2120007720/I don't think I'm interested.
2120007721/Here's your ring. I'm keeping the rest.
2120007722/Tell me more, but know that I don't kill humans.
2120007723/Farewell.
2120007724/Where exactly will I find this treasure?
2120007725/Why's this ring so precious?
2120007726/And where will I find you when I return?
2120007727/What's the deal?
2120007728/What're you talking about?
2120007729/Certainly.
2120007730/There's a commotion in the corridor!
2120007731/Shhh, he's talking...
2120007732/All right!
2120007733/I want to ask some questions.
2120007734/But I paid you!
2120007735/Who killed him?
2120007736/Why Coleman?
2120007737/I'm surprised they acted in town...
2120007738/Just?
2120007739/What happened?
2120007740/Enough. Where's Javed, where're the witchers' secrets? Spit it out before I feed you to the rats...
2120007741/Try your luck.
2120007742/Bullshit. You need encouragement...
2120007743/Where are Javed and the witchers' secrets? Talk or taste a witcher's steel...
2120007744/Cut the crap. Caught you red-handed. You're dealing with Salamandra!
2120007745/The Professor?
2120007746/Right.
2120007747/What's going on?
2120007748/Him? A Scoia'tael warrior?
2120007749/Let me walk you to the gate. These roads can be dangerous.
2120007750/I'm fine. I'll tell you what happened on the way to Vizima. I'm done with this village.
2120007751/It so happens that this lady is with me. None of you will touch her.
2120007752/That's the last time they hurt anyone.
2120007753/I'll come back for you, Shani.
2120007754/Are you all right?
2120007755/Still, I'm astounded... Do you know how the Beast came to be?
2120007756/Ahem.
2120007757/They unknowingly created it with their misdeeds. A powerful sorcerer couldn't have matched it. And all they needed was hatred, baseness and greed.
2120007758/Is that so?
2120007759/Every tale contains a grain of truth... Let's go, Vizima awaits.
2120007760/I hope I never return. It's unfathomable how many criminals live here...
2120007761/Assault is impolite...
2120007762/Before you go, apologize for your bad manners...
2120007763/When you've apologized, go see Captain Vincent. Tell him you're a criminal and a louse...
2120007764/Leave that lady be...
2120007765/Try your luck.
2120007766/I have business.
2120007767/Lost your chance.
2120007768/This woman is with me...
2120007769/So, what is it?
2120007770/I suppose it's wine...
2120007771/It'll cost 200 orens.
2120007772/I'm not interested.
2120007773/It wasn't easy, but I managed.
2120007774/You mentioned you might have a job for me. Care to elaborate?
2120007775/Farewell.
2120007776/Where's the house?
2120007777/You wanted wine.
2120007778/Just as well, I don't have the bottles...
2120007779/What's the catch?
2120007780/You need a warrior to have a drink?
2120007781/I'll finish the job soon.
2120007782/No payment, no wine.
2120007783/Fine.
2120007784/I thought this was the only tavern around...
2120007785/I...
2120007786/Woman, look at me, that thing downstairs was no son of yours. Open your eyes.
2120007787/Is she in pain?
2120007788/You looked very worried.
2120007789/I'll visit her and find out what I can. My help will cost 50 orens.
2120007790/I'm not interested.
2120007791/She'll recover soon. The job proved difficult, but we agreed on 50 orens.
2120007792/Perhaps I can help.
2120007793/Farewell.
2120007794/Where does your granny live?
2120007795/A dangerous creature lived in her basement. It tried to enslave her, but worry no more.
2120007796/She'll be fine now she's out of danger.
2120007797/No problem.
2120007798/Farewell.
2120007799/Are... are you all right?
2120007800/I lost my memory. I may once have known your language.
2120007801/This was not the best idea. Farewell.
2120007802/Let's try.
2120007803/That means "kiss."
2120007804/En'ca minne, I need to leave... A'baeth me Gwynbleidd, stupid white wolf?
2120007805/You're right... En'ca minne, a dearth of love... the Final Age, tedd deireadh...
2120007806/You come... from the land on the river of... alabaster... bridges.
2120007807/I may not know what you said, but I know what you'll say next.
2120007808/Enough, I can't understand the elder language. Farewell.
2120007809/Uhhhh... you live under the bridge?
2120007810/Yeah. Farewell.
2120007811/A'baeth.
2120007812/You're quite an accomplished teacher.
2120007813/Greetings. Sadly I don't speak the elder language.
2120007814/No idea.
2120007815/You are Feainnewedd. The Sun Child.
2120007816/You are a sunflower?
2120007817/Elaine.
2120007818/Would you teach me?
2120007819/I'm looking for work and these are the tools of my trade.
2120007820/I got to admit I walked in here out of sheer curiosity.
2120007821/Agreed.
2120007822/I don't think I'm interested.
2120007823/What did you have in mind?
2120007824/See you.
2120007825/That was pretty stupid... hiring a witcher against yourself.
2120007826/Just one thing...
2120007827/I should've known...
2120007828/Generally, yes.
2120007829/They're correct.
2120007830/All right, I can do that.
2120007831/I don't think I'm interested.
2120007832/I've been to the swamp. I may have recovered your family ring.
2120007833/You asked who I was. Have a job for me?
2120007834/Farewell.
2120007835/Where's your uncle's body?
2120007836/Listen, about the ring...
2120007837/Not yet.
2120007838/A diamond. I can't accept this. And I'm no human.
2120007839/Thanks, I don't think I'm interested.
2120007840/Some other time maybe.
2120007841/I need to go, Zoltan. We'll talk later.
2120007842/You misunderstood. I lost my memory. I only remember the last few weeks...
2120007843/Not sure I can explain much...
2120007844/So, how are you doing?
2120007845/The Breckenriggs, who are they?
2120007846/Something wrong? You don't look well. Are you hurt?
2120007847/From Mahakam? Any profit in that?
2120007848/How do I join the game?
2120007849/It's not my habit to meddle in other people's affairs.
2120007850/Zoltan, I found these strange dice. Looks like dwarven handiwork...
2120007851/Any idea where I could start?
2120007852/When will I no longer be a novice?
2120007853/Just so long it doesn't run away...
2120007854/You look like something's bothering you.
2120007855/Think he might be in trouble?
2120007856/Squirrels and hawkers?
2120007857/I see.
2120007858/I'll keep my eyes peeled, let you know if l learn anything.
2120007859/Listen, I'm sure you've heard about this Beast that hunts the peasants?
2120007860/What do you think?
2120007861/So how do you play?
2120007862/I'm not sure I'm familiar with that crap...
2120007863/I see.
2120007864/Can you play poker for serious money?
2120007865/Zoltan, you mentioned my vanishing. Any idea why I disappeared?
2120007866/Who are you?
2120007867/Can you tell me more about the Squirrels?
2120007868/It wasn't easy.
2120007869/I see you took Alvin in.
2120007870/A monkey.
2120007871/I'm no favorite, either.
2120007872/How is this relevant to our green mutts?
2120007873/A fish.
2120007874/Are you one, Abigail?
2120007875/Do you hate all humans?
2120007876/Hmmm.
2120007877/How is it made?
2120007878/I swear.
2120007879/Complicated.
2120007880/Nothing yet. What's your side of the story?
2120007881/I gathered the myrtle petals.
2120007882/I need to know where the Beast came from.
2120007883/Aren't witches wise in the ways of magic?
2120007884/Who would that be?
2120007885/Thanks, farewell.
2120007886/Where's Alvin?
2120007887/Can I ask you something?
2120007888/Won't it hurt him?
2120007889/I'll remember that.
2120007890/A man.
2120007891/Not yet.
2120007892/Heard of Alzur's Demon?
2120007893/I do.
2120007894/Do you have any magic against phantom hounds?
2120007895/Both are for monsters. Unfortunately, I lack the silver one.
2120007896/I don't. Is that important?
2120007897/What do you mean?
2120007898/Why did he do that?
2120007899/Thanks.
2120007900/I found your notice.
2120007901/Is the potion ready?
2120007902/The Reverend believes you summoned the Beast.
2120007903/He didn't look well...
2120007904/What happened to the man outside?
2120007905/Where's Alvin?
2120007906/That's good of you. Few in these times would be willing - it's another mouth to feed.
2120007907/Enough. This could end badly. Abigail, break the trance!
2120007908/I see.
2120007909/A snake.
2120007910/A kikimore.
2120007911/I do. They're yours... for a price.
2120007912/Maybe another time.
2120007913/Interesting.
2120007914/See you later.
2120007915/Possibly. I did her a favor.
2120007916/Take care.
2120007917/Lead the way...
2120007918/Possibly. I did her a favor.
2120007919/Maybe another time.
2120007920/Maybe another time.
2120007921/Are you working or out for a walk?
2120007922/I will.
2120007923/Tell me!
2120007924/Return to base.
2120007925/Return to base.
2120007926/Return to base.
2120007927/Return to base.
2120007928/Hm. I have a pass. Mikul should let us enter.
2120007929/Me too. The Beast is dead, the Salamanders are dead...
2120007930/Forgive me for being blunt, but are you a virgin?
2120007931/I don't mean to be rude, but you're certain you're...
2120007932/I know a man who's been transformed into a beast. To remove the curse I need the tear of a virgin.
2120007933/Come with me.
2120007934/I'm glad you like it...
2120007935/Greetings.
2120007936/You're worldly.
2120007937/I'm sure.
2120007938/Have you heard news of a witcher in town?
2120007939/He fancies women with or without magical abilities.
2120007940/We're good friends.
2120007941/Sad as it is...
2120007942/What's Dandelion say?
2120007943/How interesting.
2120007944/Dandelion is a rake himself...
2120007945/I dislike brothel gossip.
2120007946/You're right. They don't lie, they just 'slightly' embellish the truth...
2120007947/I doubt that too.
2120007948/It's hard living up to a legend.
2120007949/I'm Witcher Geralt of Rivia.
2120007950/Some sort of frock?
2120007951/A precious stone?
2120007952/You don't know what you're talking about.
2120007953/Some other time.
2120007954/This witcher is perfectly normal...
2120007955/I merely wanted...
2120007956/...to say that...
2120007957/I'm Geralt of Rivia.
2120007958/You're right, he can't keep his hands off any sorceress who doesn't fly away...
2120007959/Tell me something else.
2120007960/Heard any news from the nonhuman district?
2120007961/I have a problem...
2120007962/You've got a beautiful smile.
2120007963/Farewell.
2120007964/Slight exaggeration, grandma.
2120007965/What now?
2120007966/Shall I chaperone them?
2120007967/No... I really must run.
2120007968/What now?
2120007969/Not truuue!
2120007970/I have an appointment.
2120007971/Uh-huh...
2120007972/I'm here to see Shani.
2120007973/Entertaining?
2120007974/True, I don't.
2120007975/It's not like that, good woman.
2120007976/Does Shani live here?
2120007977/Move aside, woman.
2120007978/Then could you please tell her...
2120007979/I'm here to see Shani...
2120007980/I have an appointment.
2120007981/I'm here to see Shani.
2120007982/Yes, I'm from the hospital.
2120007983/I need to go.
2120007984/I'm here to see Shani.
2120007985/I'm here to see Shani.
2120007986/Move aside, woman.
2120007987/Old, grey, and a pain in the arse. You should be ashamed!
2120007988/Be silent and let me pass!
2120007989/Uh-huh...
2120007990/Does Shani live here?
2120007991/Yes, I'm from the hospital.
2120007992/Madame, I couldn't even if I wanted to... Mutation...
2120007993/Oh, die, you hag!
2120007994/I'll return that lost sheep to the fold.
2120007995/I'll go at once.
2120007996/But...
2120007997/I swear. I just can't.
2120007998/It's the famous poet, Dandelion.
2120007999/So it's true. The Salamanders stole the equipment from Kaer Morhen and have managed to complete the first mutations already.
2120008000/No need to scare me, I'm no competition. Thanks for directions.
2120008001/Farewell.
2120008002/Greetings.
2120008003/I wouldn't be alive if I weren't careful.
2120008004/Where do you gather your herbs?
2120008005/Anything happening here?
2120008006/Take care. I must leave.
2120008007/Cheers, grandma!
2120008008/That's a tall tale.
2120008009/Okay.
2120008010/What's left?
2120008011/Sounds lovely, granny...
2120008012/I'm thirsty too. But tell me something else.
2120008013/Why so tight-lipped today, grandma?
2120008014/Greetings, grandma.
2120008015/I'll hold you to your word.
2120008016/Bye.
2120008017/You are certain you're...
2120008018/Thanks.
2120008019/Would anything suffice besides honey?
2120008020/I've nothing like that. Perhaps I can pay another way.
2120008021/How much?
2120008022/I'm listening.
2120008023/A man has been transformed into a beast and to remove the curse I need the tear of a virgin.
2120008024/Thanks, maybe another time.
2120008025/Forgive me, but are you a virgin?!
2120008026/I have no shawl. Farewell.
2120008027/Truly scandalous.
2120008028/What is it?
2120008029/Run. They're after me.
2120008030/Any time.
2120008031/I'm afraid it is possible...
2120008032/Or what?
2120008033/Not likely.
2120008034/Farewell.
2120008035/They were here for me. I made a choice some time back...
2120008036/No.||No. It was the right decision, and I'll deal with the consequences.
2120008037/Yes.||Yes. Hindsight... If only I'd seen the consequences then.
2120008038/Has another witcher, Berengar, been here?
2120008039/Maybe he wanted to make some money...
2120008040/Thanks for your help.
2120008041/So you agree with the elves and dwarves fighting for independence?
2120008042/Would you like to be with me?
2120008043/Sex is pleasure and pleasure is good.
2120008044/Farewell.
2120008045/Sex relieves stress, improving body and mind.
2120008046/Tell me about your lives.
2120008047/Why don't you reach a compromise with the humans?
2120008048/You know me?
2120008049/What's that?
2120008050/What are you doing here?
2120008051/That's sad.
2120008052/We spoke about where little dryads come from...
2120008053/Come.
2120008054/Are you happy?
2120008055/Who is winning?
2120008056/Goodbye.
2120008057/Gwynbleidd? What's that mean?
2120008058/You were toying with me.
2120008059/Not yet. Soon.
2120008060/Maybe he wanted to make some money...
2120008061/I've been accused of many things, but lack of physical prowess is not among them.
2120008062/Just wanted to make sure.
2120008063/Tell me about Brokilon.
2120008064/I seek a boy. The brickmakers claim druids seized him to transform him into a dryad.
2120008065/Yes?
2120008066/A couple entwined might mix the soil they lie upon, giving improved plant growth.
2120008067/Intimacy without procreation can be good.
2120008068/Very well.
2120008069/You may know more than me. I remember nothing of my past.
2120008070/Can you help?
2120008071/You've angered me. Farewell.
2120008072/Forgive me. I need a virgin's tear to cure a man's curse.
2120008073/I thought you could help...
2120008074/Thank you.
2120008075/I see.
2120008076/The clue says... Well, read it yourself.
2120008077/I have a question about Love and Mercy.
2120008078/Thank you.
2120008079/That's kind of her.
2120008080/And the sacrifice?
2120008081/Farewell.
2120008082/I seek something and found a clue I can't understand.
2120008083/Tell me more about your goddess.
2120008084/I'm not very religious.
2120008085/Do I make my sacrifice here?
2120008086/Do you know anyone who possesses them?
2120008087/Hmm...
2120008088/What are those?
2120008089/Why does the statue represent three figures?
2120008090/I thought you could help...
2120008091/Forgive me. I need a virgin's tear to cure a man's curse.
2120008092/Thank you.
2120008093/Seen anything unusual?
2120008094/Bye.
2120008095/Maybe we should risk it?
2120008096/Let's go out back.
2120008097/Anything interesting happening here?
2120008098/What other reason?
2120008099/Off you go.
2120008100/I usually provide a warning, but I'm in a foul mood today.
2120008101/You mean this mud patch? Congratulations, great purchase.
2120008102/I'm working for elves. Don't want to mess with them, do you?
2120008103/Bye.
2120008104/When did you join the Order?
2120008105/I've no money.
2120008106/Will you sell me your wares?
2120008107/A long, metal rod.
2120008108/Is the lightning... metal rod ready?
2120008109/What does the Order do in Vizima?
2120008110/What if I give you a donation to the Order?
2120008111/She was young and fell quickly.
2120008112/Can you make a lightning rod?
2120008113/Plenty of work.
2120008114/Siegfried, the knight from the sewers?
2120008115/Here's 70 orens.
2120008116/Very well.
2120008117/What's your problem?
2120008118/Who lives here?
2120008119/Let me rephrase.
2120008120/I'll be going.
2120008121/Farewell.
2120008122/Wise dwarves are rare.
2120008123/I'm listening.
2120008124/This particular tower?
2120008125/I'll take it.
2120008126/Know anything else?
2120008127/Thanks for the advice.
2120008128/I'm looking for a book on the swamp tower.
2120008129/What are you going on about?
2120008130/I know, I know.
2120008131/I wouldn't if I were you. He's a powerful alchemist...
2120008132/Who's worth talking to?
2120008133/Why?
2120008134/Who's worth talking to?
2120008135/Why?
2120008136/Farewell.
2120008137/Where did you get milk? There's a quarantine - I've seen no cows...
2120008138/White.
2120008139/Yet you lost it gambling?
2120008140/Whichever.
2120008141/Whichever.
2120008142/Let's play some time. Start practicing.
2120008143/Godspeed.
2120008144/You seem to like what you do.
2120008145/Don't you fear the plague?
2120008146/Tell me about your mercenary days.
2120008147/Bloodshed?
2120008148/I finished that and have proof.
2120008149/I'm here about the notice.
2120008150/Red.
2120008151/You captured the sword during the battle?
2120008152/That's really far.
2120008153/Where did you get this sword?
2120008154/I noticed. Must take a lot of work.
2120008155/Yellow.
2120008156/I'm more interested in silver swords.
2120008157/Strong women... nothing on this earth like them.
2120008158/You lost it playing dice?
2120008159/Interesting story. Thanks.
2120008160/You were saying...
2120008161/You play dice?
2120008162/Certainly.
2120008163/Like most of us.
2120008164/Whichever.
2120008165/May I ask for roses in exchange?
2120008166/Thanks.
2120008167/Farewell.
2120008168/What's the problem?
2120008169/Anything interesting? Shops, taverns...?
2120008170/You'd hardly be the first to know.
2120008171/What's the tavern?
2120008172/What about the gates?
2120008173/Where do I find them?
2120008174/Where are the merchants?
2120008175/What's the hospital like?
2120008176/I must go.
2120008177/I saw people with Salamander badges in town...
2120008178/But...
2120008179/Care to say why?
2120008180/Farewell.
2120008181/As you wish.
2120008182/I'm going inside.
2120008183/Farewell.
2120008184/Tell me more about this hunter.
2120008185/Does the town face famine?
2120008186/How do I do that?
2120008187/What's happening in the swamp?
2120008188/Tell me more.
2120008189/What's a state of quarantine?
2120008190/Wha?
2120008191/To help or not to help. That's the witcher's question.
2120008192/Bye.
2120008193/What are you selling?
2120008194/What use are your goods?
2120008195/I have a question.
2120008196/What idol?
2120008197/Where can I find information about a goddess?
2120008198/The hospital...?
2120008199/Farewell.
2120008200/I'm not entirely human. And yes, you might have something I need...
2120008201/Will you sell me your wares?
2120008202/Nice workshop -- you must be proud... but where's your equipment?
2120008203/Don't have it yet. Back soon.
2120008204/50 orens, like we agreed.
2120008205/Can you make a lighting rod?
2120008206/Deal.
2120008207/The lightning rod...?
2120008208/Thieves?
2120008209/Would you make me a lightning rod? A long, metal...
2120008210/I don't need a coffin. I don't intend to die anytime soon.
2120008211/What if Thaler cancelled your debts?
2120008212/I'm here about the notice.
2120008213/He seems to be struggling with this case. I should help. Will you let me inside the cemetery?
2120008214/At the hospital.
2120008215/Farewell.
2120008216/I'm here for another reason.
2120008217/I see.
2120008218/You seem to know a lot about the deaths in the city. Ever help with investigations?
2120008219/I bought your debts from him. But you must help me.
2120008220/I have a pass from Captain Meis.
2120008221/You're sick.
2120008222/How can I change your mind?
2120008223/You're not likely to tell me anything interesting.
2120008224/About the prisoner...
2120008225/What business?
2120008226/Maybe you can tell me, too?
2120008227/Monsters?
2120008228/Won't hurt to check.
2120008229/No other way to sway you?
2120008230/I'll deal with it when you agree to pay me. For now, farewell.
2120008231/I understand you need 6 jugs of dog's lard?
2120008232/Cemetery still closed?
2120008233/I have 6 jugs of dog's lard.
2120008234/What are you talking about?
2120008235/Could you hand over the prisoner's body for an autopsy?
2120008236/I found Raymond's body in the crypt.
2120008237/A prisoner died recently. Is he in the cemetery already?
2120008238/Here's your key.
2120008239/Right.
2120008240/I want to get inside the cemetery.
2120008241/I'm after a specific corpse.
2120008242/I'll think about it.
2120008243/Stop fooling. I need something else.
2120008244/Now I'm sure. The leader of Salamandra, a mage capable of spinning illusions, is masquerading as Raymond.
2120008245/I don't trust Raymond. He's hiding something.
2120008246/Why is the cemetery shut?
2120008247/Tell me something else.
2120008248/Not yet. Wait for me here.
2120008249/I'll find you later.
2120008250/How many times are you going to ask me that? To the swamp.
2120008251/Where do you go?
2120008252/Take me to the other side.
2120008253/Hm... Pike can be good too.
2120008254/Good luck.
2120008255/You're doing most of the talking.
2120008256/Keep your shirt on. Can I ask why?
2120008257/How long will this last?
2120008258/Why wouldn't you let the emperor pass?
2120008259/Now I see why we won the war.
2120008260/Not yet. Wait for me here.
2120008261/I'll find you later.
2120008262/I wouldn't have paid you otherwise. Take me to town.
2120008263/Where do you go?
2120008264/Take me to the other side.
2120008265/Yaren sends his greetings. I have the herbs.
2120008266/I don't know how much more time I'll need. Beggartick's a rare plant.
2120008267/Here, five beggartick blossoms as agreed.
2120008268/I'll be sure to.
2120008269/I haven't gathered all the herbs yet. You'll have to wait.
2120008270/I've decided to keep them.
2120008271/Right, thanks.
2120008272/Know anything about the missing boy from your village?
2120008273/Where is he?
2120008274/I'm looking for beggartick blossoms.
2120008275/Know anyone who might remember it being built?
2120008276/I'm collecting information on the mage's tower.
2120008277/What did the Squirrels want?
2120008278/Great tip, thanks!
2120008279/I know what I'm doing. Farewell.
2120008280/Take care.
2120008281/What did you say?
2120008282/Tell me about these knights.
2120008283/Thank you, friend.
2120008284/And what did you answer?
2120008285/I'm collecting information on the mage's tower...
2120008286/Know anything about the missing boy from your village?
2120008287/Thanks. I'd prefer my actions to be private.
2120008288/Worry not. Salamandra doesn't threaten me.
2120008289/I seek beggartick blossoms.
2120008290/The Salamanders know I've been to the swamp...?
2120008291/Don't mention it.
2120008292/What's this?
2120008293/I see.
2120008294/Thank you. Farewell.
2120008295/Huh?
2120008296/I accept and will use it well.
2120008297/You have more need for it.
2120008298/Thank you.
2120008299/Thank you, friend. The bandits will threaten you no more.
2120008300/Know anything about the missing boy?
2120008301/Where is he?
2120008302/I'm looking for beggartick blossoms.
2120008303/Know anyone who might remember it being built?
2120008304/I'm collecting information on the mage's tower.
2120008305/Thanks.
2120008306/Why did you give me a potion's formula?
2120008307/The brickmakers claim you change children into dryads.
2120008308/I seek a boy missing from the brickmakers' village.
2120008309/I'm looking for beggartick blossoms.
2120008310/Where can I find him?
2120008311/I'll check.
2120008312/I can't find Yaevinn. What happened to him?
2120008313/Know where I might find a copy of 'Ain Soph Aur'?
2120008314/At the tower?
2120008315/Thank you.
2120008316/Farewell.
2120008317/And you do?
2120008318/I seek information on the mage's tower.
2120008319/Has anyone tried?
2120008320/I'll be careful. Farewell.
2120008321/I placed the order for the storm.
2120008322/I'm looking for herbs.
2120008323/You train wild animals... And you can stir up a storm?
2120008324/What posts?
2120008325/Aren't those wyverns?
2120008326/I need a thunderbolt.
2120008327/Farewell.
2120008328/Undeniably.
2120008329/I'll be looking for those storm clouds.
2120008330/I'll come back when you change your mind.
2120008331/I'll get a lightning rod.
2120008332/You druids control nature's forces, right?
2120008333/How are the posts activated?
2120008334/500 it is.
2120008335/Shouldn't a storm have dark clouds, thunder and lightning, and a downpour? There wasn't any.
2120008336/Any accidents?
2120008337/Storms still 500 orens?
2120008338/How did you master them?
2120008339/Mother Nature maintaining her margins?
2120008340/That's too much.
2120008341/I'll pay. Call it a donation toward the prevention of further devastation of the environment.
2120008342/Well, I need a tempest with thunder and lightning. Can you create one?
2120008343/Maybe I can use the posts to wake the golem?
2120008344/A wticher without potions is half a witcher, druid.
2120008345/Here's 500 orens. I await my storm.
2120008346/I see.
2120008347/Caught anything?
2120008348/Farewell.
2120008349/Good luck.
2120008350/How about a taste?
2120008351/I'm looking for beggartick blossoms for Yaren.
2120008352/I seek information on the mage's tower.
2120008353/I'm looking for beggartick blossoms for Yaren.
2120008354/I'm looking for beggartick blossoms for Yaren.
2120008355/I seek information on the mage's tower.
2120008356/Very well.
2120008357/I seek information on the mage's tower.
2120008358/I seek beggartick blossoms for the lumberjack Yaren.
2120008359/I seek information on the mage's tower.
2120008360/Thank you.
2120008361/Not entirely. I know few of the local plants.
2120008362/What do you mean?
2120008363/I don't remember elven history. Tell me about feainnewedd.
2120008364/You're blinded by hatred. I've picked feainnewedd.
2120008365/I find this conversation tiring. Farewell.
2120008366/Don't apologize, think! Not all humans are mindless barbarians.
2120008367/That's too much.
2120008368/Gods bless.
2120008369/Still too much.
2120008370/Farewell.
2120008371/I'm not interested.
2120008372/Give my greetings to the children.
2120008373/Show me what you have.
2120008374/And you agree to that?
2120008375/Don't lose the sword. I'll look for it by your dead body in the sewers.
2120008376/I saved your life. The cockatrice is no joke.
2120008377/Let's do it.
2120008378/Why are you here, elf?
2120008379/Mhm.
2120008380/I'm not in the mood.
2120008381/Why are you doing this?
2120008382/You knew, but did nothing.
2120008383/No need. I'll speak with the villagers.
2120008384/Men summoned the Beast with their wicked deeds.
2120008385/Really?
2120008386/It's clear why the Beast haunts you. I need to expose the guilty. Stay here while I speak to those outside.
2120008387/Abigail, I was drawn to you from the start...
2120008388/Why are you here, witch?
2120008389/Lots of smoke in your magic.
2120008390/You profited from the poison.
2120008391/I best be going. Farewell.
2120008392/There seems to be no shortage of booze at this table, so I don't see how it's a problem. Take care.
2120008393/I suppose I could have a drink...
2120008394/No thanks. Take care.
2120008395/Geralt of Rivia, I'll be glad to drink with you.
2120008396/I'll have some of that, thanks.
2120008397/I had no idea...
2120008398/Depends on what's to drink and with whom.
2120008399/Cirrhosis of the liver?
2120008400/Somebody mention a prize?
2120008401/You've been out-drunk!
2120008402/Thanks.
2120008403/You got lucky that time.
2120008404/I await my prize.
2120008405/All right, mercy!
2120008406/Gladly.
2120008407/I have my ups and downs.
2120008408/I'm a witcher. Aren't you afraid I'll jinx the dice?
2120008409/You make ends meet, gambling?
2120008410/I think you've seen the last of him.
2120008411/Where is it worth playing?
2120008412/I might just take you up on that.
2120008413/Take care.
2120008414/He was unlucky in love, too.
2120008415/Silver sword. Mean anything to you?
2120008416/I don't have time for chitchat.
2120008417/Where can I find him?
2120008418/Where did you get the sword?
2120008419/All right. Let me try something else...
2120008420/A dealer named Angus.
2120008421/I'll pass.
2120008422/Haren Brogg asked me to deliver this parcel.
2120008423/That's life.
2120008424/What do those nuts get out of it?
2120008425/You could say so.
2120008426/Listen, I'm looking for a man...
2120008427/Well I lost track of him. I just met him to collect gold for a job.
2120008428/Any rooms?
2120008429/Where can I find him?
2120008430/I didn't notice anything unusual...
2120008431/So long.
2120008432/We'll talk later.
2120008433/Where can I find this Coleman?
2120008434/All right. I'll look around.
2120008435/I caught him informing.
2120008436/All right.
2120008437/What's with all this betting?
2120008438/Seen Coleman?
2120008439/I found Coleman.
2120008440/No, still a member. But I hear they're looking for you.
2120008441/Sounds good.
2120008442/With Coleman dead, who will sell me fisstech?
2120008443/Farewell.
2120008444/Can I have a look?
2120008445/You the smith's apprentice?
2120008446/See you.
2120008447/Show me your wares.
2120008448/You the smith's apprentice?
2120008449/Vizima's Temple Quarter. Whores, murderers and beggars - Salamandra's base must be near...
2120008450/Hmm... interesting. The private eye Siegfried mentioned. Could be helpful... Have to start somewhere.
2120008451/You're a big girl, you'll manage.
2120008452/Your peasant quarrels don't interest me.
2120008453/You're apt to lose those shortly...
2120008454/What could possibly shock her?
2120008455/Secluded and quiet...
2120008456/Ghosts wouldn't dare disturb a witcher. Others will stay away out of fear.
2120008457/No need. See you.
2120008458/Shall we meet again?
2120008459/You're all right. They're gone.
2120008460/Let's go. We're almost there.
2120008461/Certainly.
2120008462/Closed. This guy's actually out investigating.
2120008463/Looks like I have to deal with these idiots.
2120008464/Sephira and obelisk merged - the old spells still work.
2120008465/All the Sephirot are set. My medallion's vibrating like mad, so the spell must be working. The tower door should be open. I can't wait to see Kalkstein's reaction.
2120008466/Must have been the wrong item.
2120008467/The obelisk seems ancient. Pity I don't understand these runes...
2120008468/Gnawed human bones! Brains...! I'm gonna puke.
2120008469/Old Vizima. Beyond that gate, the catriona plague kills dozens every day. I have a feeling the quarantine's useless.
2120008470/The town cemetery. The dead and undead await behind that gate. Plenty of work for a witcher.
2120008471/Saint Lebioda's Hospital - for victims of the catriona plague. Only two stages after this - Old Vizima and Hell. Damn I'm gloomy.
2120008472/Return to Abigail. She'll be worried.
2120008473/If the Reverend raises his hand again, find me quickly.
2120008474/Alvin, why are you here?
2120008475/The aesculapian snake. I'd love to meet the fool who associated skin-shedding with medicine.
2120008476/The elder races inhabit this district. Dwarven craftsmen and elven artists...
2120008477/Huge trees, strange symbols, tamed beasts, even a dryad... This must be the druids' grove.
2120008478/Odd place. Looks like these giants froze mid-motion. Must've been some time ago.
2120008479/Looks like this tower collapsed on its own. I guess the swamp's not the best place for buildings this big.
2120008480/Vapors, drowners and wet feet - that's all I'll find here.
2120008481/Looks like a brickmakers' village.
2120008482/These boggy holes must be clay pits.
2120008483/Hmm... A cave entrance...
2120008484/Three women... this reminds me of something. There's an altar at the base.
2120008485/Why is that?
2120008486/Death.
2120008487/I do. You chased me. You and your ghastly hunting party.
2120008488/There is no destiny, only coincidence, blind chance...
2120008489/Yes...
2120008490/Say I believe you. Will you tell me my destiny?
2120008491/That's not all. There's death, but there's also free will. I'll find Salamandra and fulfill my own destiny!
2120008492/I'll prove there's no destiny. I shall give you what I have but do not expect.
2120008493/Think again.
2120008494/You babble, ghost. Say your peace or disappear.
2120008495/No.
2120008496/That smell! Must've died ages ago.
2120008497/Incredible... Vizima boasts a 'bad neighborhood'!
2120008498/Let's just have a drink.
2120008499/Shani...
2120008500/Shani, don't be so touchy.
2120008501/You're getting wound up unnecessarily. It's a profession like any other.
2120008502/Let's drink to our lovely ladies.
2120008503/Shani, this is Carmen, a lady whose virtues you'll appreciate.
2120008504/Dandelion, meet...
2120008505/Hmm.
2120008506/It's fine. I actually found something interesting. The old lady's diary.
2120008507/Then you must tell the truth...
2120008508/One track mind.
2120008509/Let's drink to her health.
2120008510/I'd rather go downstairs.
2120008511/Don't remember... I have amnesia.
2120008512/Shani, you don't have to answer. I'll go downstairs.
2120008513/Ahem...
2120008514/Dandelion, don't go there...
2120008515/What game?
2120008516/I'll be back shortly.
2120008517/What did you see, Dandelion?
2120008518/What did you see, Dandelion?
2120008519/Sounds a bit like a ballad...
2120008520/And it's no joke.
2120008521/No, I'm no ghost...
2120008522/You've had too much to drink, poet.
2120008523/I don't know what you're talking about. Lost my memory.
2120008524/I haven't come here to talk about the past. I'm alive and well. Let's drop the subject.
2120008525/I lost my memory, but I want to know why everyone's so surprised to see me alive. Tell me everything, step by step.
2120008526/What?
2120008527/All, meaning who?
2120008528/Are you telling me everything?
2120008529/I guess I don't die so easily.
2120008530/Listen, Dandelion, I don't have proof, because that's impossible. I don't remember... I'm afraid some things can't be explained.
2120008531/Let's sit down, have a drink like old friends. Time will tell who I am.
2120008532/What did you see, Dandelion?
2120008533/Cheers!
2120008534/You were about to enlighten me...
2120008535/You were about to enlighten me...
2120008536/Don't hold back, Dandelion. It doesn't suit you.
2120008537/They're rare... I don't know.
2120008538/Dandelion...
2120008539/Silver sword, potions... what're you driving at?
2120008540/You said we've been through a lot together, so you should know...
2120008541/Vampires are born from black magic, evil by nature. Negotiation usually ends with one of the parties losing a lot of blood - and it's rarely the vampire.
2120008542/Don't hold back, Dandelion. It doesn't suit you.
2120008543/You were about to enlighten me...
2120008544/Dandelion, believe me - if you could tell a bruxa to hunt rabbits, for instance, I'd be long unemployed.
2120008545/They inherently drink blood. But I think you have something else in mind.
2120008546/Cheers!
2120008547/Right on.
2120008548/Don't hold back, Dandelion. It doesn't suit you.
2120008549/Let's drink.
2120008550/Like Carmen said, it's fascinating, so amazing it's unbelievable.
2120008551/You were going to enlighten me about vampires.
2120008552/Can you give me a last name, Dandelion?
2120008553/Did I also have a friend who was a dragon?
2120008554/Where'd you learn this?
2120008555/Let's drink.
2120008556/Are you having a laugh at my expense?
2120008557/Let's drink.
2120008558/Can you explain, Dandelion?
2120008559/Enlighten me, please...
2120008560/Can you give me a last name, Dandelion?
2120008561/Where'd you learn this?
2120008562/Did I also have a true friend who was a dragon?
2120008563/Am I the only one who's confused?
2120008564/What happened to this Regis?
2120008565/Where'd you learn this?
2120008566/Did I also have a friend who was a dragon?
2120008567/Let's drink.
2120008568/We'd love to hear one.
2120008569/But Shani...
2120008570/Where did you learn?
2120008571/We'd love to hear it.
2120008572/Dandelion, don't we need to be somewhere?
2120008573/The good old times.
2120008574/We'd love to hear it.
2120008575/A friend, she'll arrive soon.
2120008576/They're not all like that. Siegfried's different.
2120008577/A knight named Siegfried, you'll like him.
2120008578/Zoltan Chivay, know him?
2120008579/Just a feeling.
2120008580/I hope you don't mind that I invited Carmen.
2120008581/I admire you, Shani.
2120008582/Tell me about the Battle of Brenna.
2120008583/I hope you like Siegfried.
2120008584/Tell me about the Battle of Brenna.
2120008585/I admire you, Shani.
2120008586/I'm glad...
2120008587/Tell me about the Battle of Brenna.
2120008588/I'm glad.
2120008589/I hope you don't mind that I invited Zoltan.
2120008590/I admire you, Shani.
2120008591/Not just now.
2120008592/All right.
2120008593/Nothing yet.
2120008594/Why through the cave?
2120008595/And you are...?
2120008596/I'll do what I can.
2120008597/These are your friend's remains.
2120008598/Forgetting something?
2120008599/Echinopsae.
2120008600/Of those or not, I sense you have a job for me.
2120008601/You think he's dead?
2120008602/What's "decent"?
2120008603/I buried your friend.
2120008604/But we agreed...
2120008605/It was a decent burial.
2120008606/Why, then?
2120008607/Gesundheit.
2120008608/Greetings.
2120008609/It's coming.
2120008610/My eyes are watering.
2120008611/Let's test it.
2120008612/A little.
2120008613/Lard... and pickles.
2120008614/All right, I'll be right back.
2120008615/You're joking!
2120008616/Shani?
2120008617/Wait a second. Why me?
2120008618/Stunning logic! But no!
2120008619/Zoltan...
2120008620/The Order does its duty.
2120008621/Maybe that was a bit strong...
2120008622/Greetings, Siegfried.
2120008623/Hmmm...
2120008624/The Scoia'tael murder innocents. They've abandoned their fight for freedom to fight the human race.
2120008625/Siegfried, you should really visit the nonhuman ghetto and see the conditions there.
2120008626/I'm afraid, Siegfried, that Dandelion may be right, at least in part.
2120008627/An exception that proves the rule.
2120008628/Don't just stand there, Siegfried.
2120008629/We'll see.
2120008630/Ask away.
2120008631/Here's the liquor.
2120008632/I see. Fair enough, I'll be right back.
2120008633/Are you nuts, Siegfried? I'm not going anywhere.
2120008634/You want me to steal the old lady's wine?
2120008635/Why do I think I'm not going to like this?
2120008636/Why don't you go yourself, Siegfried?
2120008637/Sorry, I just can't.
2120008638/Another round?
2120008639/I don't want trouble... Here...
2120008640/Step away or your mother will be mourning you by evening...
2120008641/What do you want?
2120008642/Get a job, maggot. Stop bothering us travelers!
2120008643/I have no coin...
2120008644/Here's two orens - make sure you drink to my health.
2120008645/I don't give a goat's ass about your road!
2120008646/Try it, fool!
2120008647/Here's 100 orens - now go.
2120008648/Greetings.
2120008649/I don't doubt it. Did the convention reach any specific conclusions?
2120008650/I wanted to ask you about alchemy...
2120008651/I’m not exactly a local. And think about it - if the locals were all interested in alchemy, they wouldn't have much need for you...
2120008652/Relax, pay first.
2120008653/Hmm, well, I wish you luck.
2120008654/Then I'm not sure I see the sense...
2120008655/Need any help from a witcher?
2120008656/I respect science and scientists, alchemists, too. And I guess I expect the same in return.
2120008657/You don't look like a local...
2120008658/And if I don’t have a coupled atanator handy...?
2120008659/They say you need ghoul blood.
2120008660/Where do I get ingredients?
2120008661/That explains it.
2120008662/Farewell.
2120008663/I don't think you could afford it...
2120008664/I think I've heard enough...
2120008665/Keep talking and I might change my mind, regarding alchemists, that is.
2120008666/I'll come back when I've gathered some.
2120008667/You were talking about returning to Vizima.
2120008668/We need to change the subject before the peasants decide to burn us at the stake...
2120008669/How do you obtain alchemical bases?
2120008670/Geralt, witcher.
2120008671/Do you ask everyone for permission to examine or dissect them?
2120008672/I’m interested in formulae.
2120008673/...And get drunk and spend his last money on whores... I think I see the point now...
2120008674/Huh? They looked normal to me.
2120008675/Care to elaborate?
2120008676/What kind of objects?
2120008677/People believe in the strangest things...
2120008678/Wild dogs in the swamp?
2120008679/I had a bad dog experience recently. Think I'll skip visiting the cave.
2120008680/Let's move on.
2120008681/Treasure?
2120008682/Who are the Vrans?
2120008683/What's that?
2120008684/Someone misplace the key?
2120008685/What's this Sentry?
2120008686/You're beginning to sound like a mystic. Just the facts, please.
2120008687/Complicated way to open a door.
2120008688/You seem to know a lot. Where'd you get this information?
2120008689/What was this wizard doing?
2120008690/Sephirot and pillars?
2120008691/Enough, let's go.
2120008692/You know about herbs?
2120008693/Know any other uses for herbs?
2120008694/Useful...
2120008695/Indeed. My medallion trembled a bit.
2120008696/How can I draw Power?
2120008697/That's it?
2120008698/Interesting, but let's go.
2120008699/What besides training would I need to absorb Power?
2120008700/I'm a witcher.
2120008701/And what's the truth?
2120008702/Tell me about Places of Power.
2120008703/How can I use Power?
2120008704/Is that all?
2120008705/Very true.
2120008706/I'm not your son.
2120008707/What about the Circle of Elements?
2120008708/Thanks, gramps. That helps.
2120008709/Another witcher? What can you tell me about him?
2120008710/I'm not so interested in that.
2120008711/Stop! Don't go out there alone!
2120008712/Behind you!
2120008713/True.
2120008714/I killed an archespor in the swamp.
2120008715/What?
2120008716/Public nuisances?
2120008717/I killed a cockatrice.
2120008718/What's a giant centipede embody?
2120008719/I killed an old female wyvern. Here's proof.
2120008720/I killed a huge wolf. Here's its head.
2120008721/Tell me more.
2120008722/Where did you learn about monsters?
2120008723/Farewell.
2120008724/Wyverns don't hunt humans without provocation.
2120008725/What pays well?
2120008726/The outskirts cramping you?
2120008727/Meaning?
2120008728/The hierophant revealed the cure for lycanthropy. But I must know your beloved's name.
2120008729/Did the potion work?
2120008730/I'll try to help him. Listen carefully...
2120008731/Carmen, I already know Vincent's the werewolf.
2120008732/Let's hope your loyalty isn't his doom.
2120008733/Finally.
2120008734/Your competition?
2120008735/So she's popular?
2120008736/Here's a magic potion against lycanthropy. It should help.
2120008737/Don't tell anyone I did this for free. I have my reputation...
2120008738/What's your real name?
2120008739/I spoke to the hierophant about your man's... affliction.
2120008740/Overnight, Vincent should wear a shirt woven from fool's parsley and the spell will be lifted.
2120008741/I'll fetch some fool's parsley leaves.
2120008742/I brought the parsley leaves. Weave a shirt for Vincent to lift the spell.
2120008743/Did the shirt cure Vincent?
2120008744/Calm down, Carmen. Maybe another method will be more effective.
2120008745/I've heard stories of true love changing beasts into men.
2120008746/"Love" means more than frolicking in bed.
2120008747/Carmen...
2120008748/Well... Witchers are hardly experts on matters of love.
2120008749/Listen... It's clear Vincent's lycanthropy isn't your biggest problem. Tell him you love him and how you tried to cure him. If he's not a complete swine, he'll react.
2120008750/He needs to set his priorities straight.
2120008751/I saw Vincent.
2120008752/Sometimes the simplest solutions are best.
2120008753/That's good to hear. True love can work wonders.
2120008754/Farewell.
2120008755/Know anything about a blue-eyed girl bitten by vampires?
2120008756/We'll find another way.
2120008757/Werewolves are tough to kill. And witchers don't always kill monsters. Whenever possible, we lift curses and spells. How were you planning to help him?
2120008758/That's possible.
2120008759/You seem distressed and scared. Maybe I can help, but you'll have to tell me what's wrong.
2120008760/The swamp's too dangerous. I'll ask the druids for medicine for you.
2120008761/Aren't you afraid of swamp monsters?
2120008762/Why are you in the swamp? It's dangerous.
2120008763/What's wrong?
2120008764/Don't wander about searching for druids. You'll be killed before you find them.
2120008765/Bye.
2120008766/A word of advice - if anything attacks, run, don't fight. The swamp monsters are hungry and dangerous.
2120008767/It's over. The Salamander leader is dead.
2120008768/Indeed. How do you know me?
2120008769/Greetings.
2120008770/I come on behalf of a woman whose beloved transforms into a werewolf. She wishes to find a cure.
2120008771/Farewell.
2120008772/Greetings, Honorable Hierophant. Vaska said you might be able to help with the bandits wearing salamander badges.
2120008773/I have the mushroom you wanted.
2120008774/I see.
2120008775/What do you think of the Scoia'tael?
2120008776/I'm ready!
2120008777/They may disapprove of you sheltering Scoia'tael.
2120008778/And humans do not?
2120008779/Thanks for the advice.
2120008780/Mhm.
2120008781/And why do we need this mushroom?
2120008782/Is the meeting set?
2120008783/I'll remember that, too.
2120008784/You know?
2120008785/I must attend to urgent matters...
2120008786/I've never fought alongside a wyvern.
2120008787/I play, so we might sit down to a game some time.
2120008788/I lost my memory and don't remember Mousesack.
2120008789/Can you help?
2120008790/I'm not yet ready.
2120008791/You said we'd leave when I was ready.
2120008792/What can I do?
2120008793/Really?
2120008794/I may have known once, but I can no longer recall the method.
2120008795/What of a magical cure, an elixir?
2120008796/We have mutual friends?
2120008797/Bandits have appeared in the swamp...
2120008798/I see. I'll try to learn the werewolf's identity.
2120008799/Why?
2120008800/NOT_USED
2120008801/NOT_USED
2120008802/I was born ready.
2120008803/You don't say.
2120008804/Not now, Dandelion.
2120008805/Who's Toruviel?
2120008806/I don't recall.
2120008807/In the Valley of Flowers?
2120008808/What's so special about this lute?
2120008809/In what?!
2120008810/Got up the courage to tell me about the lute?
2120008811/If I can...
2120008812/Then you have a problem.
2120008813/I'm not in the mood for music, Dandelion. We'll talk later.
2120008814/Here's your lute.
2120008815/What happened to your lute?
2120008816/See you.
2120008817/Tell me about this merchant.
2120008818/Why wouldn't you tell me earlier?
2120008819/Well...
2120008820/Was I supposed to bring you something?
2120008821/I haven't found the lute yet.
2120008822/All right, I'll fetch your lute.
2120008823/You've had enough, Dandelion.
2120008824/Where is she now?
2120008825/I remember that...
2120008826/What did you do this time?
2120008827/Typical...
2120008828/All right, I'll do my best to find it...
2120008829/When's your performance?
2120008830/I doubt city guards appreciate poetry...
2120008831/How did you get in the Trade Quarter?
2120008832/I don't have time now.
2120008833/What happened to the lute?
2120008834/I guess...
2120008835/Why should I care?
2120008836/Not yet. I just wanted to make sure you still needed them.
2120008837/Farewell.
2120008838/I have the recommendation letter. The trail leads to the sewers.
2120008839/I wager I can cut off your nose before you can sneeze again.
2120008840/We'll see. Tell me what you know.
2120008841/Where do I begin?
2120008842/I don't hunt humans.
2120008843/I killed the drug lord.
2120008844/Maybe you should disappear.
2120008845/Deal fisstech again and I'll make sure you're never found.
2120008846/Farewell, Jethro - remember what I said.
2120008847/I'm here about the notice.
2120008848/I do.
2120008849/You look ill, Jethro.
2120008850/You're going to crash.
2120008851/Like to gamble? I do.
2120008852/About what? You won't toss me into the sewers again!
2120008853/Don't worry about me. I have my potions.
2120008854/That's the only reason I'm still talking to you. But don't give me any more orders. Is that clear?
2120008855/Fisstech softens your brain. I'll do it.
2120008856/Self defense...
2120008857/Excellent plan! Perhaps I should kill everyone involved in trafficking fisstech? Or maybe I inform Vincent you're seizing goods?
2120008858/Gellert's the one responsible.
2120008859/Um, maybe you can tell me about this later.
2120008860/How goes your research?
2120008861/Uh-huh.
2120008862/Take care.
2120008863/Can you make a potion to cure lycanthropy?
2120008864/The potion's for a werewolf. The beloved of a young woman...
2120008865/Did you finish the lycanthropy potion?
2120008866/Wait, you said nothing about a virgin.
2120008867/Argh, Kalkstein. You need to get out more. Where will I find a virgin?
2120008868/What are you doing in this tower?
2120008869/I'm here about the notice.
2120008870/Yes, three fresh doses, like the notice said.
2120008871/Not yet, but I'll be back.
2120008872/Here it is.
2120008873/No, ghoul blood.
2120008874/Not yet.
2120008875/Kalkstein...
2120008876/Thaler.
2120008877/Ramsmeat.
2120008878/I don't have that much.
2120008879/Here's your coin.
2120008880/No matter. You Angus?
2120008881/Play nice, asshole! Who supplies you?
2120008882/Spit it out - who are your suppliers?!
2120008883/I need some stuff...
2120008884/Jethro.
2120008885/Kalkstein.
2120008886/Four ounces.
2120008887/All right, I'll take that recommendation...
2120008888/See you around.
2120008889/I asked nicely and got nothing... Maybe this will work...
2120008890/I'll hurry there now.
2120008891/How will I recognize him?
2120008892/So what's the plan?
2120008893/Right...
2120008894/Good news, I hope.
2120008895/How's that possible?
2120008896/How does that involve me?
2120008897/Who do you have in mind?
2120008898/You're mad, Leuvaarden.
2120008899/What will you do?
2120008900/And you have an offer for me.
2120008901/I'll see what I can do.
2120008902/What did you learn from those documents?
2120008903/I found a magical stone at the Salamander hideout.
2120008904/What is it?
2120008905/Get to the point.
2120008906/Let me guess. You have dirty work needs doing and thought a witcher with amnesia perfect for the job...
2120008907/I'll think about it.
2120008908/I found allies.
2120008909/I'll do just that.
2120008910/I thought...
2120008911/I'll help, but it hardly means we're friends.
2120008912/The swamp and slums again. Great.
2120008913/Yes, Sir! Permission to commence mission, Sir!.
2120008914/Much simpler to sacrifice one witcher... I'll return once I have new information.
2120008915/About those Salamanders...
2120008916/Meaning?
2120008917/I have the papers you wanted.
2120008918/I'm getting tired of this espionage crap.
2120008919/May I ask something?
2120008920/I see many expensive foods here. How do you feel about Vizima's starving?
2120008921/If you helped a few...
2120008922/Farewell.
2120008923/It's not that simple.
2120008924/In the brickmakers' village....
2120008925/I need help with an investigation in the swamp.
2120008926/What of it?
2120008927/I need help with an investigation in the Temple Quarter.
2120008928/We'll talk later.
2120008929/Certainly.
2120008930/Not yet.
2120008931/I'm here about the notice.
2120008932/Shani...
2120008933/Shani, about Alvin...
2120008934/It's nothing compared to you...
2120008935/I'll tell you once I've spoken with her.
2120008936/I never puke after vodka, humpf...
2120008937/Is Alvin safe?
2120008938/I left the boy with Triss to keep him safe.
2120008939/Course.
2120008940/Shani...
2120008941/Paying a visit.
2120008942/Farewell.
2120008943/Shani, I need to think... I'm not normal...
2120008944/I -- well, if I must. All right, I'm on my way.
2120008945/Mhm... Shani...
2120008946/I need some air...
2120008947/Triss wasn't happy, but she'll understand eventually.
2120008948/Actually, I don't think I know why.
2120008949/I identify with nonhumans to a degree. Like me, they're despised outcasts.
2120008950/Couldn't you just read my mind?
2120008951/Triss, about Alvin...
2120008952/Is he safe?
2120008953/Do you think I chose like I would have before?
2120008954/All right. I'll think about it.
2120008955/I'm not embarrassed. I want my memory back, now.
2120008956/Do you think I've chosen as I would have... before I lost my memory?
2120008957/Was I really so reasonable?
2120008958/I have the royal edicts.
2120008959/Enough about that.
2120008960/Perhaps.
2120008961/Which proved effective.
2120008962/Any results?
2120008963/Why not now?
2120008964/So how do these passes work?
2120008965/So what do I do?
2120008966/I'm ready. Let's meet at the New Narakort.
2120008967/Elder Blood?
2120008968/Uh, Triss... Shani has the child. I think he's better off staying with her.
2120008969/If you say so.
2120008970/I have a hunch. I'll check it out.
2120008971/Ah, Triss, I'm beginning to doubt these conversations will get me anywhere.
2120008972/We'll see.
2120008973/All this soul searching has yet to restore my memory.
2120008974/Triss, I...
2120008975/Short distances, interesting. Can you check the last communication?
2120008976/How did you get here?
2120008977/I'll try.
2120008978/I don't understand the nonhumans. Of two evils, I think the Order is the lesser one.
2120008979/No specific reason, I just decided to help the Order.
2120008980/But?
2120008981/It's complicated. I'll tell you once I've had a chance to talk to her.
2120008982/Humpf, I'm out of here...
2120008983/Triss...
2120008984/You could...
2120008985/What do you mean?
2120008986/What are friends for?
2120008987/We'll talk later.
2120008988/Magic anomalies? In Vizima?
2120008989/I thought I was at full strength.
2120008990/You found me in the swamp? What happened there?
2120008991/I'm sure you read beyond that.
2120008992/Another time, Triss.
2120008993/A pass?
2120008994/I -- well, if I have to. Though I'd rather face a swarm of ghouls...
2120008995/Triss... How did I get here?
2120008996/Maybe I can help. Care to tell me anything more about them?
2120008997/What's with the passes?
2120008998/How do you know who...
2120008999/Uh, I spoke with Shani. She understood but didn't take it too well...
2120009000/How can a child be the source?
2120009001/I placed the sensors as you asked.
2120009002/Where?
2120009003/All right, give me the sensors. I'll take care of it.
2120009004/Can't you just tell me what you saw?
2120009005/I shouldn't take an interest in the past?
2120009006/We'll see.
2120009007/Can you help me...?
2120009008/A small chance of what?
2120009009/Meaning...?
2120009010/How'd I miss that?
2120009011/Just limit the psychobabble...
2120009012/I'll think about it.
2120009013/I don't know...
2120009014/What?
2120009015/I'll see you later.
2120009016/I don’t like banquets...
2120009017/We'll talk later.
2120009018/Explain.
2120009019/I'll see what I can do. Will they let me take him?
2120009020/You said something about magic anomalies.
2120009021/I don't recall...
2120009022/All right, I'm convinced... Maybe I can gather some information there.
2120009023/See you.
2120009024/Listen, I've found us some allies.
2120009025/Listen, about my identity...
2120009026/Can't this wait? I have this job, client's getting impatient...
2120009027/Sounded serious.
2120009028/Who were you talking to through the mirror?
2120009029/Agreed.
2120009030/Fine. I'll come by later.
2120009031/I understand the nonhumans' ideals and agree with them to an extent. The elves and dwarves are fighting for freedom and dignity, causes that deserve to be aided.
2120009032/Any way to check that?
2120009033/I concluded I'm human. Yes, I was subjected to mutation at Kaer Morhen, but that didn't strip me of my humanity. And then I trained to protect humans.
2120009034/Know anything more about that magic communicator I gave you?
2120009035/Triss, about Alvin...
2120009036/Hope so.
2120009037/I'm still analyzing.
2120009038/I decided to help Yaevinn and the Scoia'tael against the Order of the Flaming Rose.
2120009039/I agreed to help Siegfried and the Order of the Flaming Rose. I wonder if the former Geralt would have done the same.
2120009040/So...
2120009041/Meaning?
2120009042/Listen, I found a magical stone at the Salamandra hideout.
2120009043/Perhaps.
2120009044/About my identity...
2120009045/I decided to help Yaevinn and the Scoia'tael.
2120009046/Not finding this party dull?
2120009047/I'm still analyzing.
2120009048/No specific reason, I just decided to help the Order.
2120009049/What's the Gift of Lara?
2120009050/I don't understand the nonhumans. Of two evils, I think the Order is the lesser one.
2120009051/I agreed to help Siegfried and the Order of the Flaming Rose. I wonder if the former Geralt would have done the same.
2120009052/Actually, I don't think I know why.
2120009053/I identify with nonhumans to a degree. Like me, they're scorned outcasts.
2120009054/I understand the nonhumans' ideals and agree with them to an extent. The elves and dwarves are fighting for freedom and dignity, causes that deserve to be aided.
2120009055/I concluded I'm human. Yes, I was subjected to mutation at Kaer Morhen, but that didn't strip me of my humanity. And then I trained to protect humans.
2120009056/Do you think I've chosen as I would have... before I lost my memory?
2120009057/If you say so.
2120009058/Do you think I chose like I would have before?
2120009059/We'll see.
2120009060/How can a child be the source?
2120009061/Sure you're not using me as one of your tools?
2120009062/Enough about that.
2120009063/Was I really so reasonable?
2120009064/One I can't refuse?
2120009065/Listen, I found a magical stone at the Salamandra hideout.
2120009066/Ah, Triss, I'm beginning to doubt these conversations will get me anywhere.
2120009067/Pleased to hear it.
2120009068/So what have you decided?
2120009069/What's so worthy of my time?
2120009070/And?
2120009071/I placed the sensors as you asked.
2120009072/Where?
2120009073/Elder Blood?
2120009074/I'll see what I can do. Will they let me take him?
2120009075/Use plain language.
2120009076/So...
2120009077/I'll find you later.
2120009078/I'm not embarrassed. I want my memory back, now.
2120009079/Hmm...
2120009080/I certainly hope so.
2120009081/Triss, about the boy...
2120009082/All this soul searching has yet to restore my memory.
2120009083/All right. I'll think about it.
2120009084/See you.
2120009085/I heard you're having problems. Drowners again?
2120009086/Thanks.
2120009087/Farewell.
2120009088/I'll do just that.
2120009089/Hmm, who are these strangers?
2120009090/How dreadful.
2120009091/Where are they?
2120009092/Hm?
2120009093/Speak, Vaska.
2120009094/Anything else while I was away?
2120009095/May I ask a question?
2120009096/That's very interesting.
2120009097/I'll do that.
2120009098/He's hard to understand...
2120009099/...I feel... truly honored... for... for who is greater than the Water Lords?
2120009100/I'm still searching for your missing kin.
2120009101/I found your missing child.
2120009102/So he's supposed to be that way.
2120009103/I'm glad to help.
2120009104/Tell me about this battle.
2120009105/I freed all the brickmakers. They confirmed the Salamandra's evil deeds.
2120009106/Who won?
2120009107/None lived to tell the tale. I found a human corpse - you'll pay for that.
2120009108/Agreed.
2120009109/What are you?
2120009110/Enough lies. Die!
2120009111/I found some human corpses.
2120009112/Thanks. Now shove off.
2120009113/Enough! That's your last meal.
2120009114/And your group leaves them alone?
2120009115/Uuuuh.
2120009116/Not one that talks.
2120009117/Farewell.
2120009118/Carmen asked me to see you.
2120009119/Any new monster jobs?
2120009120/I can lift the curse, but you must desire it. You want to be with Carmen?
2120009121/Love can move mountains, but...
2120009122/Will you give up your superhuman strength for love?
2120009123/Strength that will one day consume you. You still have a choice.
2120009124/In brief, Carmen doesn't like you being a werewolf.
2120009125/You want thanks?
2120009126/You kill humans...
2120009127/This explains your disappearances at night...
2120009128/Enough! Defend yourself!
2120009129/Go on.
2120009130/Witchers kill monsters.
2120009131/Monsters are monsters. Defend yourself!
2120009132/You know me?!
2120009133/Why should I spare you?
2120009134/I'll say nothing, monster.
2120009135/Nothing special.
2120009136/I can help you break the werewolf spell.
2120009137/You kill them without a fair trial, Vincent.
2120009138/No, he refused. But they have "mutual friends."
2120009139/You're right. Appearances don't matter.
2120009140/Radovid spoke to the Salamanders through a teleprojection.
2120009141/Why shouldn't I?
2120009142/Your destiny is death. Here and now...
2120009143/Die, monster!
2120009144/I don't know who'd want to...
2120009145/Yaevinn, do you really believe you can win?
2120009146/Greetings, you made it back unscathed.
2120009147/Good to hear.
2120009148/At a tavern in the Trade Quarter, the New Narakort.
2120009149/See you later.
2120009150/It'll be worth your time, I assure you.
2120009151/Does that mean you'll meet with them?
2120009152/I have powerful friends... who see a way to destroy that organization.
2120009153/I have an offer. Do you want to see Salamandra destroyed?
2120009154/Clearly...
2120009155/No... And that's strange.
2120009156/Flaming spears of destruction.
2120009157/I saved the humans thrown to the ghouls, but the murderers fled...
2120009158/Besides the talking ghoul, the Scoia'tael played a role, robbing graves and slaying anyone in their path.
2120009159/Know anything about the cemetery?
2120009160/Congratulations.
2120009161/Greetings.
2120009162/Why are you here?
2120009163/Bye.
2120009164/No... I need a virgin's tear to cure lycanthropy.
2120009165/Thanks.
2120009166/The Hobos.
2120009167/I dealt with the cemetery issue, but...
2120009168/I'll consider it.
2120009169/You have fresh troops...
2120009170/I have powerful friends... who can destroy that organization.
2120009171/May I ask... did you take a vow of celibacy?
2120009172/I don't understand...
2120009173/Hmm, details are unimportant. I solved the cemetery problem.
2120009174/A strange post-conjunctive being. I found it feasting...
2120009175/I slew the murderers, but couldn't save the humans thrown to the ghouls.
2120009176/Siegfried...
2120009177/With what?
2120009178/If you detest Salamandra, I have a proposition.
2120009179/I can't now, but I'll return if possible.
2120009180/I'll go look.
2120009181/They're doing fine against dummies...
2120009182/Is there payment?
2120009183/A talking ghoul caused the strange disappearances...
2120009184/Besides the talking ghoul, the Scoia'tael played a role, robbing graves and slaying anyone in their path. But...
2120009185/That's your job.
2120009186/Still manning your post?
2120009187/Dazzling.
2120009188/I'm not acquainted with monastic names.
2120009189/Time will tell.
2120009190/A visionary?
2120009191/Have you taken the vow of celibacy?
2120009192/I need a virgin's tear to cure someone of lycanthropy.
2120009193/Thanks.
2120009194/Did you get your medal?
2120009195/How's your leg?
2120009196/Everything all right?
2120009197/I see...
2120009198/No. I won't join with that vow of celibacy.
2120009199/The New Narakort tavern. Come by tonight.
2120009200/Wait for our signal.
2120009201/Good-bye.
2120009202/Siegfried, you trusted me at the bank...
2120009203/I have powerful friends... who know how to destroy it.
2120009204/I've a proposal. Will you help me destroy Salamandra?
2120009205/Yet...
2120009206/But I...
2120009207/Calm yourself!
2120009208/Geralt of Rivia, witcher. I apologize for the intrusion.
2120009209/He caught Dandelion? Doing what?
2120009210/That's why I'm here...
2120009211/Take care.
2120009212/Heard any interesting gossip?
2120009213/I'm leaving.
2120009214/We settled matters...
2120009215/He's like that...
2120009216/I would stop short of the marriage proposal. No one would believe it.
2120009217/Now can I take the lute?
2120009218/Can I cheer you up somehow?
2120009219/Is that an obscene song?
2120009220/If you give up the lute, it'll prove he's nothing to you. You dumped him.
2120009221/He's my friend.
2120009222/Causes a slight tingling... Let me show you.
2120009223/Uhhh... That's not really possible.
2120009224/I'm here about the lute...
2120009225/He'll be fine.
2120009226/It's a myth. I'll take the lute and bother you no more...
2120009227/You'd demonstrate that your character, the beauty of your soul, outshines even your rosy cheeks...
2120009228/It's more his problem...
2120009229/I'd prefer a peaceful resolution...
2120009230/Listen, good man...
2120009231/I've heard enough insults.
2120009232/I want nothing from your daughter...
2120009233/Relax. I'm leaving.
2120009234/I want my friend's lute.
2120009235/NOT_USED
2120009236/NOT_USED
2120009237/NOT_USED
2120009238/NOT_USED
2120009239/NOT_USED
2120009240/NOT_USED
2120009241/NOT_USED
2120009242/NOT_USED
2120009243/NOT_USED
2120009244/Who would I be otherwise?
2120009245/I chose the lesser evil.
2120009246/Be back with something nice soon.
2120009247/Are you propositioning me?
2120009248/A game of dice?
2120009249/With pleasure.
2120009250/Who runs this place?
2120009251/Some other time.
2120009252/I don't play too well...
2120009253/I'm in.
2120009254/I get it.
2120009255/I found this place myself.
2120009256/Farewell.
2120009257/Who's worth talking to?
2120009258/Nothing. What place is this?
2120009259/Nothing. Take care.
2120009260/See you.
2120009261/Who are they? I epitomize discretion.
2120009262/Is this your place?
2120009263/Regulars must be recommending the place.
2120009264/Bribes won't get you by?
2120009265/Is this your butler?
2120009266/Prison's not bad.
2120009267/Salamandra?
2120009268/Hmm.
2120009269/Farewell.
2120009270/I thought only wholesalers came to market.
2120009271/Farewell.
2120009272/What are you peddling?
2120009273/Farewell.
2120009274/Do you make potions?
2120009275/Farewell.
2120009276/You don't look Zerrikanian.
2120009277/Farewell.
2120009278/Any alcohol?
2120009279/What do you want?
2120009280/I'll be back.
2120009281/I've changed my mind.
2120009282/What's the cost?
2120009283/I'd like my weapon enhanced.
2120009284/A gemstone? Why not gold?
2120009285/Farewell.
2120009286/You're a swordsmith.
2120009287/I'd like my sword enhanced.
2120009288/I'm only interested in what you have to offer.
2120009289/No one sent me.
2120009290/What are you peddling?
2120009291/We'll see about that.
2120009292/Why won't you join the guild?
2120009293/Who's taking over the guild?
2120009294/Farewell.
2120009295/Thanks for the information. Good luck.
2120009296/Who owns the factory?
2120009297/I hope you meet your quota.
2120009298/Can I contact them?
2120009299/Can I purchase arms?
2120009300/Who's ordering weapons these days?
2120009301/Business goes well.
2120009302/Just curious.
2120009303/Who are these swords for?
2120009304/What is this place?
2120009305/Relax, I get it.
2120009306/I get it. There are two factions at court, one of which ordered weapons while the other remains ignorant...
2120009307/Just one more thing...
2120009308/Actually, I was raised in the woods.
2120009309/You produce weapons?
2120009310/Hmm.
2120009311/So, a contract.
2120009312/The royal court imposed secrecy. Can’t the royal court know about the order?
2120009313/Thank you. 'Til next time.
2120009314/Do you have alchemical ingredients for sale?
2120009315/Bye.
2120009316/Which book?
2120009317/Isn't alchemy a science?
2120009318/Maybe useful.
2120009319/After transmutation, substances continue to attach and detach from the chain. There are always six.
2120009320/Good luck.
2120009321/Transmutation of the chain means the spiral has the properties of the sixth substance.
2120009322/Thanks.
2120009323/I haven't read Kalkstein's books.
2120009324/My friend Kalkstein considers himself an alchemist.
2120009325/Good luck.
2120009326/I'll return with the ore.
2120009327/Secondary substances don't appear of themselves. The distinction is justified.
2120009328/Primary substances appear only together with secondary ones.
2120009329/Which book?
2120009330/Like what?
2120009331/Very well, "Metamorphoses" is hogwash.
2120009332/Primary substances do not appear on their own.
2120009333/Seriously? I'll review it.
2120009334/Kalkstein writes about co-existence, not co-dependence. Entirely different.
2120009335/According to Kalkstein's theories, you could construct a golem.
2120009336/Enough discussion. Bye.
2120009337/Have I convinced you about Kalkstein?
2120009338/I empathize.
2120009339/I had an itch in my nose there.
2120009340/What do you do?
2120009341/The sixth substance demands re-organization. The chain passes through transposition first and then transmutation.
2120009342/In that case... I'll return soon for my cut.
2120009343/Seriously?
2120009344/Too brittle?
2120009345/But I didn't sneeze.
2120009346/Kalkstein's theories illustrate how to conduct effective mutations.
2120009347/I'll try not to.
2120009348/Yes?
2120009349/When we first spoke, you mentioned Zerrikanian masters.
2120009350/Kalkstein denies that all substances are co-dependent. His hypothesis pertains to primary substances only.
2120009351/"Metamorphoses"... not bad.
2120009352/You can impress ladies with Kalkstein's theory.
2120009353/I see you know what you want.
2120009354/This shrew needs taming...
2120009355/You're a naughty girl.
2120009356/I'm getting some pretty clever ideas myself.
2120009357/Lead, milady.
2120009358/What's your whim?
2120009359/I'll get back to you.
2120009360/I'll fulfill your every dream, milady.
2120009361/Work at town hall?
2120009362/I'll think about it.
2120009363/I need a virgin's tear to cure lycanthropy.
2120009364/Thanks.
2120009365/Excuse me, madam. Are you a virgin?
2120009366/Nothing.
2120009367/Forgive me for being this forward, but you wouldn't happen to be a virgin?
2120009368/I need a virgin's tear to make a potion for a very ill man.
2120009369/I don't mean to be rude, but you're sure you're a...
2120009370/It crossed my mind.
2120009371/That's right.
2120009372/That's possible.
2120009373/Well...
2120009374/Goodbye.
2120009375/You're sure you're...
2120009376/Forgive me, but are you a virgin?
2120009377/I need a virgin's tear to cure someone of lycanthropy.
2120009378/Financially?
2120009379/Yaevinn.
2120009380/Geralt of Rivia.
2120009381/I'm disguised as a lowly vagrant. I must lay the heads of twelve monsters at the feet of the damsel who holds my heart.
2120009382/Siegfried.
2120009383/That was a little embarrassing. I should go.
2120009384/I'm Erasmus Xenophont the Genderless.
2120009385/Good art supports itself. See you.
2120009386/Sorry to be blunt, but are you a virgin?
2120009387/I need a virgin's tear to add to a potion for a very ill man.
2120009388/I don't mean to be rude, but you're certain you're a...
2120009389/I'm sorry. I need to go.
2120009390/Not entirely true... But what's your point?
2120009391/Lead, m'lady.
2120009392/Oh no, I fancy you.
2120009393/You have an assignment for me, M'Lady?
2120009394/M'lady, you're wrong.
2120009395/I'm honored, but I must refuse.
2120009396/A kikimore's claw:?
2120009397/Speak.
2120009398/Interesting.
2120009399/Thanks.
2120009400/The weaver of this web of intrigue is so radiant, I must forgive.
2120009401/I am a man of action, not of words.
2120009402/Regretfully, no.
2120009403/Yes, but I must go.
2120009404/And you I find courteous, m'lady.
2120009405/Not my intention, m'lady.
2120009406/Regretfully, no.
2120009407/I must take my leave. Farewell.
2120009408/Excuse me, but... are you a virgin?
2120009409/I need a virgin's tear to make a potion for a very ill man.
2120009410/I don't want to be impolite, but you're sure you're...
2120009411/Thanks, goodbye.
2120009412/Thanks, bye.
2120009413/Amazing how many times I've heard that crap...
2120009414/You say whatever drivel you like.
2120009415/I don't think anything.
2120009416/You bore me.
2120009417/Hmm?
2120009418/You've mistaken me for someone else.
2120009419/You're a pathetic underling, so I'll leave you be.
2120009420/Tell them we'll meet soon.
2120009421/Who wants to know?
2120009422/They should talk to me themselves.
2120009423/I have a message for these mutual friends.
2120009424/Tell them I'm ready to talk.
2120009425/Some market stalls stand empty.
2120009426/Got any shark?
2120009427/Good luck.
2120009428/Bye.
2120009429/Not much competition for you.
2120009430/Take care.
2120009431/Gladly.
2120009432/Do you recognize me? Anything about me?
2120009433/And?
2120009434/Do you know Princess Adda?
2120009435/What does your wife say about the other courtiers?
2120009436/Hmm, thanks.
2120009437/Interesting, thanks.
2120009438/What about Jacques de Aldersberg?
2120009439/Any gossip about Triss Merigold?
2120009440/What've you heard about Roderick de Wett?
2120009441/We'll see.
2120009442/What's the word on Velerad?
2120009443/I'd be happy to listen if I could look at your goods.
2120009444/You exaggerate. Foltest's rule can't be that unpleasant.
2120009445/Enough of that already.
2120009446/Tell me about Foltest.
2120009447/The dog's name is Adda?
2120009448/Bye.
2120009449/Later.
2120009450/Strange views.
2120009451/Don't you fear bad-mouthing authorities during martial law?
2120009452/Bold words.
2120009453/I'm not common and I'm not interested in ruling.
2120009454/I wish you luck.
2120009455/I'm not sure I'm interested in gossip.
2120009456/You're right.
2120009457/Thanks for the advice.
2120009458/Let's see them.
2120009459/How's business?
2120009460/Tell me about your goods.
2120009461/What do you have?
2120009462/Thanks for the advice.
2120009463/I see.
2120009464/What do you recommend?
2120009465/Good day.
2120009466/I do.
2120009467/Thanks again.
2120009468/What did the creature look like?
2120009469/A kikimore?
2120009470/A professional description, thanks.
2120009471/Monsters?
2120009472/What did you hear, knight?
2120009473/I'll take care of them.
2120009474/So, not a warrior. Thanks for the information.
2120009475/Should I kick their asses or just drill them?
2120009476/Know anything about fleders?
2120009477/I'll remember that.
2120009478/Mhm.
2120009479/Thanks for the story.
2120009480/I'm listening.
2120009481/Great story, made my flesh crawl. Farewell.
2120009482/Sounds familiar.
2120009483/Interesting, thanks.
2120009484/You don't say...
2120009485/I didn't know you tell stories.
2120009486/What would you like?
2120009487/Sorry, I don't have any.
2120009488/I don't feel like any stories. Farewell.
2120009489/I'd be glad to listen.
2120009490/I'll pass.
2120009491/I'll take it.
2120009492/You're welcome.
2120009493/You'll find a better one.
2120009494/Can I help?
2120009495/I really need to leave.
2120009496/Not at all.
2120009497/This should be useful.
2120009498/I...
2120009499/Any rooms?
2120009500/Take care.
2120009501/I can give you coin for gloves and you can pay the woman.
2120009502/Oo, sorry, I don't have any coin. Good luck.
2120009503/I have a pair of gloves. You're welcome to them.
2120009504/I just realized I don't have them. Bye.
2120009505/But I...
2120009506/No.
2120009507/Farewell.
2120009508/Not at all... but I remembered I left milk on the fire. See you.
2120009509/Why? He give you trouble?
2120009510/I'm here about the notice.
2120009511/Ever listen in?
2120009512/Thanks. Farewell.
2120009513/I gather they wear Salamander symbols.
2120009514/Can I look at them?
2120009515/That information isn't worth what I paid you.
2120009516/Stretch your memory.
2120009517/I'm sure they've said something interesting.
2120009518/Thanks for the information. Bye.
2120009519/Thanks. Farewell.
2120009520/I do.
2120009521/Any other interesting customers?
2120009522/I need rest. Got a room?
2120009523/Lovely inn. You must host many an illustrious guest.
2120009524/Know his name?
2120009525/Maybe some gold will untie your tongue.
2120009526/I'm invited. Tell me more.
2120009527/Who's backing Leuvaarden?
2120009528/Tell me about the meetings that occur upstairs.
2120009529/Nonhumans live in Vizima.
2120009530/You sure?
2120009531/I'm listening.
2120009532/I'll pass.
2120009533/I'll return.
2120009534/I was expecting valuable information.
2120009535/What was the password?
2120009536/Greetings.
2120009537/Tough. Farewell.
2120009538/I'd like my money back then.
2120009539/Scoundrel.
2120009540/And then what?
2120009541/What did they talk about?
2120009542/Not yet.
2120009543/Then I wish you many wealthy customers.
2120009544/So neither druids nor dryads kidnapped you.
2120009545/Are you the brickmakers' lost child?
2120009546/Okay, hurry home.
2120009547/Right, I'll be going.
2120009548/Hm. The salamander sign... Hope I meet them soon.
2120009549/Thank you.
2120009550/Apparently.
2120009551/I saw bunches of flowers on the way...
2120009552/I'll look around...
2120009553/Angus said I might score some fisstech here.
2120009554/Password.
2120009555/Any reason why you're in the sewers?
2120009556/Later.
2120009557/Let me in or regret it ...
2120009558/Flame.
2120009559/What's beyond the grate?
2120009560/Fisstech.
2120009561/Salamandra.
2120009562/Thorn.
2120009563/I don't want you slacking off.
2120009564/Don't worry, I won't tell.
2120009565/Relax, I'm not here to check on you.
2120009566/One pound.
2120009567/Where's the boss?
2120009568/Angus sent me.
2120009569/I'd gladly hear them.
2120009570/The Order of the Flaming Rose eliminates monsters?
2120009571/Unfair competition, I'd say.
2120009572/Thanks for the story. Farewell.
2120009573/Interesting story, thanks.
2120009574/A happy ending, though I would have preferred it explan how to cure lycanthropy.
2120009575/Thanks, anyway. Farewell.
2120009576/Tell me about them.
2120009577/Great story, but if vampires multiplied as you describe, they'd quickly control the world.
2120009578/Good luck.
2120009579/Thanks, I'll remember that.
2120009580/What is Salamandra doing in the swamp?
2120009581/You're free.
2120009582/Return home.
2120009583/What do you know about Salamandra.
2120009584/Salamandra is involved in the drug trade? Thanks. Return home.
2120009585/No, I came on my own. You're free.
2120009586/Before you go, tell me what you know about Salamandra.
2120009587/Thank you.
2120009588/Murderers.
2120009589/I doubt you'll live long.
2120009590/I'm afraid your friends are dead...
2120009591/I've killed most of them. The passage should be clear. Get out of here.
2120009592/I'm not liking this... Better check the cellar.
2120009593/The hideout of Vincent the werewolf. Did he think himself a superhero?
2120009594/Where the hell am I? Triss overdid it this time.
2120009595/Although... better here than the middle of some banquet...
2120009596/I hope no one heard that. Wait, I wasn't supposed to be alone...
2120009597/I can't open this door without a key...
2120009598/I should gut the kikimore. If the Professor had any valuable information, it'll be in there...
2120009599/Bites, scratches, bones crushed for the marrow... the work of ghouls.
2120009600/Hmmm... No bites, only puncture wounds and cuts, dagger marks...
2120009601/One could say so, Princess.
2120009602/Forgive me, milady, but even the finest dress would pale in comparison to you.
2120009603/I see you still wear the gemstone with the inclusion. The curse...
2120009604/But, the curse may yet...
2120009605/Your Highness?
2120009606/A-hem... Forgive me, Your Highness...
2120009607/The similarities are evident.
2120009608/What are you asking, milady?
2120009609/I'm not sure I know.
2120009610/I'm here with Triss...
2120009611/Forgive me, princess, I didn't mean...
2120009612/Hm, you're right, princess. I'm trying to learn who's scheming and why...
2120009613/May I ask you a question?
2120009614/What is the king's stance on this topic? I mean politics, of course.
2120009615/I shall return shortly, Your Highness.
2120009616/My curiosity will remain unsatisfied. Allow me, milady, to take my leave.
2120009617/Very well.
2120009618/Ha ha.
2120009619/What a waste, indeed.
2120009620/You may be right, Your Highness. Power, sex. Sex, power. They both come down to one thing - fucking others.
2120009621/Not entirely.
2120009622/I am impressed by the comparison. Have you ever tried your hand at the fine arts, Your Highness?
2120009623/I agree. Books are for bores...
2120009624/Ahem... excuse me, Your Highness, sore throat.
2120009625/Not all men. I have no desire to meddle in politics, for instance.
2120009626/Steak tartare of catoblepas. Raw meat with a pinch of pepper and an uncooked yolk.
2120009627/I need more time, Your Highness.
2120009628/It is an honor to serve you, Your Highness.
2120009629/Please grant me another chance, Your Highness.
2120009630/As you command...
2120009631/Your Highness...
2120009632/I'll not be your toy.
2120009633/I must refuse.
2120009634/Your Highness promised me an answer...
2120009635/Your Highness...
2120009636/You blew it.
2120009637/A heron?
2120009638/Sure you won't betray me?
2120009639/He speaks.
2120009640/Farewell.
2120009641/Greetings.
2120009642/Point for you. Truth is, I was hoping for a superior drink.
2120009643/Huh? I wa.. I was looking for the privy.
2120009644/I found this liquor. Try some?
2120009645/This is none of your business. Get lost.
2120009646/I don't, but I do know this cut that leaves the victim with one ear, one cheek and half a jaw. People survive it, but playing the flute is just one of the things they can't do.
2120009647/And how are you involved? Are you bound by his vows... by extension?
2120009648/Good day, Sir.
2120009649/Indeed...
2120009650/Thaler? Here?
2120009651/I said I was an old-fashioned witcher. Be straight, like Thaler the fence would be.
2120009652/I'm done playing your games, Thaler. Farewell.
2120009653/Exquisitely. Not enough food, nowhere to sit, and nothing but small talk. And I may be the only one here not involved in one of the many schemes or secret alliances being forged.
2120009654/They're criminal, evil to the core... Salamandra upsets the balance. As a witcher, I can't ignore that.
2120009655/Who exactly is De Wett, and what is he doing here?
2120009656/Thaler the fence is a scoundrel who'd prefer the Temple District not know he consorts with the cream of Vizima society.
2120009657/Is Leuvaarden somehow involved?
2120009658/Maybe the princess has a game of her own going?
2120009659/Start talking. What's Adda's favorite dish?
2120009660/What?
2120009661/What do you mean?
2120009662/I trust Triss.
2120009663/But...
2120009664/Both.
2120009665/Ideological.
2120009666/Explain.
2120009667/Personal.
2120009668/I'm a relic, someone from the past, so I'm rather attached to the old customs. Never understood nor liked the new ones. But really, Thaler. Why are you here?
2120009669/Why do you want to draw me into a game that doesn't concern me?
2120009670/Excuse me for a moment. We'll talk later.
2120009671/Smoothly, here's the letter.
2120009672/They robbed me and killed a friend. That enough?
2120009673/Who exactly are you? And be straight with me... comrade.
2120009674/Thanks, that's what I needed to know.
2120009675/Missed my chance... I'll be back.
2120009676/They robbed me and killed a friend. They're criminal, evil... Salamandra upsets the balance. As a witcher, I can't ignore that.
2120009677/How's the meat prepared?
2120009678/You're joking.
2120009679/Calm down, what's the dish?
2120009680/Any idea what the princess' favorite dish might be?
2120009681/Who's this enemy? Who wants to steal our women?
2120009682/To me, too.
2120009683/A highly placed spy...
2120009684/That's private. I want to destroy Salamandra. That is my only objective.
2120009685/I'll keep that in mind.
2120009686/Mhm.
2120009687/Can't we go back to your place, make sure I have no internal injuries?
2120009688/Nothing I can't handle.
2120009689/No. Triss, could you conjure up something, please.
2120009690/That spoiled little vixen... well, she wants some catoblepas. Rare would be best.
2120009691/Uh, this is important, Triss.
2120009692/From me? But I'm just a witcher...
2120009693/I'll create a distraction...
2120009694/Adda knows something... I think I can get it out of her.
2120009695/Thank you, Triss.
2120009696/I think I prefer traditional methods... I'll find you after I've spoken with Adda.
2120009697/I'll remember that.
2120009698/Charmed.
2120009699/Relax, burgomeister... The party's just beginning.
2120009700/I hope so.
2120009701/I'm not asking out of want for political influence.
2120009702/Riiiight.
2120009703/Any strange behavior?
2120009704/What does the princess like to eat?
2120009705/When will the King return?
2120009706/...about the curse.
2120009707/Will do.
2120009708/Can I ask about politics?
2120009709/I want to ask about the princess...
2120009710/Farewell.
2120009711/I see. Anything else?
2120009712/Does the princess have strange dreams?
2120009713/Spit it out.
2120009714/Is she aggressive?
2120009715/Thanks.
2120009716/Later.
2120009717/What?
2120009718/Be watchful...
2120009719/Go away!
2120009720/I have nightmares...
2120009721/Tell me what you saw.
2120009722/Possibly.
2120009723/Not until the phantom reappears.
2120009724/Why did it appear?
2120009725/What were they like?
2120009726/Not now.
2120009727/You saw a phantom?
2120009728/I'll stay alert.
2120009729/Sorry, kid.
2120009730/I helped.
2120009731/Waiting for your kin to come?
2120009732/Why is that?
2120009733/And the quarantine and patrols aren't enough?
2120009734/See you there.
2120009735/I'll do my best to comply.
2120009736/Godspeed.
2120009737/I'm coming.
2120009738/What was that about martial law?
2120009739/The lily has yet to be engulfed by fire.
2120009740/The lily has yet to be engulfed by fire.
2120009741/No, I made a mistake.
2120009742/I agreed to meet a friend here...
2120009743/You could've thought up an easier password.
2120009744/They know we're here?
2120009745/I mean...
2120009746/The lily has yet to be engulfed by fire.
2120009747/And they're probably much easier to capture...
2120009748/I better go.
2120009749/I'm sorry...
2120009750/Aren't there more pressing problems? What about the plague, monsters...
2120009751/Everything ready?
2120009752/A medal?
2120009753/Is it?
2120009754/You're not coming with me?
2120009755/Uh, I'm looking for...
2120009756/But I just wanted to...
2120009757/In the flesh.
2120009758/Hahaha! Any other stunning remarks or can we start killing?
2120009759/What if I refuse? Witchers are simple and sentimental.
2120009760/Your dazzling conclusion?
2120009761/If Salamandra is not evil incarnate, then what of Javed? Amorality, rape, murder, treason... What would you call this creature?
2120009762/Hahaha! Any other stunning remarks or can we start killing?
2120009763/Screw that future. I'd rather fight a nightmare, even if it's hopeless.
2120009764/Your point?
2120009765/Spit it out.
2120009766/Screw that future. I'd rather fight a nightmare, even if it's hopeless.
2120009767/Wrap it up.
2120009768/If Salamandra is not evil incarnate, then what of Javed? Amorality, rape, murder, treason... What would you call this creature?
2120009769/If Salamandra is not evil incarnate, then what of Javed? Amorality, rape, murder, treason... What would you call this creature?
2120009770/Screw that future. I'd rather fight a nightmare, even if it's hopeless.
2120009771/You're wrong, just like you're wrong about so many other things.
2120009772/And if I refuse?
2120009773/What's your point, Javed?
2120009774/What if I refuse? Witchers are simple and sentimental.
2120009775/I see we're all here. Good. We can resolve this...
2120009776/Your dazzling conclusion?
2120009777/Hahaha! Any other stunning remarks or can we start killing?
2120009778/Your dazzling conclusion?
2120009779/Don't think so...
2120009780/And if I refuse?
2120009781/Spit it out.
2120009782/Wrap it up.
2120009783/Your dazzling conclusion?
2120009784/Hahaha! Any other stunning remarks or can we start killing?
2120009785/If Salamandra is not evil incarnate, then what of Javed? Amorality, rape, murder, treason... What would you call this creature?
2120009786/Screw that future. I'd rather fight a nightmare, even if it's hopeless. Though this time it isn't.
2120009787/I seriously doubt it.
2120009788/I may be out of luck in a direct confrontation...
2120009789/Supports? Hmm... I could try toppling them to block the passage.
2120009790/If I buried this entire cave... the beast would never survive.
2120009791/If I don't run out, the entire Salamandra base will land on my head!
2120009792/Not entirely...
2120009793/Fools.
2120009794/We'll see.
2120009795/You don't understand... Vincent was...
2120009796/Let's dance!
2120009797/What? Captain Vincent...
2120009798/We'll see.
2120009799/Surrender.
2120009800/You over-educated asshole. It's reckoning time.
2120009801/Prattle on...
2120009802/Enlighten me.
2120009803/Well this ineffective, doubt-ridden, historical freak is about to kill you. Let's dance.
2120009804/Just shut the fuck up!
2120009805/You're so full of shit, Professor!
2120009806/I should meet Triss and the others upstairs.
2120009807/Anything else?
2120009808/Did they let him into Vizima?
2120009809/How did you know?
2120009810/Customers aren't exactly lining up.
2120009811/Shouldn't answer a question with a question.
2120009812/This meat looks odd. What's it from?
2120009813/That doesn't help me much.
2120009814/Let's do business.
2120009815/Thanks.
2120009816/So try to remember what you already told me.
2120009817/Tell me more about the other witcher.
2120009818/See you.
2120009819/Don't get yourself killed. If anything should happen to you, Carmen...
2120009820/No, I won't. I must speak to the others!
2120009821/What? Why?
2120009822/Then I'll face them. You run.
2120009823/So I'll face them. You run.
2120009824/You too, werewolf.
2120009825/Maybe there's another way...
2120009826/Decided anything?
2120009827/I didn't foresee this...
2120009828/Are you crazy?!
2120009829/The door is locked...
2120009830/Greetings.
2120009831/When?
2120009832/Ready for what?
2120009833/Yaevinn? You're here after all...
2120009834/Where's Triss?
2120009835/Strange... I don't recall giving it to her...
2120009836/Alzur's Shield...
2120009837/Any ideas?
2120009838/Yeah... Not dead yet.
2120009839/Leave this to me.
2120009840/Yaevinn... What happened?
2120009841/Alzur's Shield?
2120009842/I know the story.
2120009843/Can we use it?
2120009844/Soup? Maybe, uh...
2120009845/Decided anything?
2120009846/I didn't foresee this problem...
2120009847/Is that wise?
2120009848/The door is locked...
2120009849/Greetings.
2120009850/When?
2120009851/Misunderstandings?
2120009852/Any ideas?
2120009853/Siegfried?!
2120009854/Alzur's Shield...
2120009855/I am... alive...
2120009856/What... happened?
2120009857/Alzur's Shield?
2120009858/Strange... I don't recall giving it to her...
2120009859/I know the story.
2120009860/I'll find him.
2120009861/Where's Triss?
2120009862/Can we use it?
2120009863/You're overdoing it with the passes.
2120009864/He's returned?
2120009865/Farewell.
2120009866/Yes?
2120009867/Geralt, witcher.
2120009868/Yes.
2120009869/Thanks, officer.
2120009870/I need one to walk the streets?
2120009871/A pass - and I'll slay every kikimore I find.
2120009872/Can you be clearer?
2120009873/Who are you?
2120009874/Listen, Radovid, I don't much care what you like. You'd better explain your connection to Salamandra - I'm sure we'll meet someday.
2120009875/A tool?
2120009876/Farewell, King.
2120009877/You know Triss?
2120009878/Greetings, Radovid.
2120009879/Well, there's the way you spoke of Redania, of Adda... And then there's your ring....
2120009880/What do you want to know?
2120009881/Who are you? And I don't mean your name...
2120009882/From what I've seen, the upper crust in Temeria is the same...
2120009883/I believe so. One of the Knowing could examine her...
2120009884/True...
2120009885/I don't see why not.
2120009886/I trust Triss.
2120009887/If you say so...
2120009888/Enough. You've convinced me, but I'm not Adda.
2120009889/What's your connection to Adda?
2120009890/I've heard about them.
2120009891/They don't accept sorcerers?
2120009892/You know Thaler?
2120009893/Who is Philippa?
2120009894/Tell me more...
2120009895/Should I fetch them?
2120009896/I'll consider it.
2120009897/I've brought the royal edicts.
2120009898/You wanted something?
2120009899/So Foltest didn't declare martial law?
2120009900/Farewell.
2120009901/I generally don't meddle, so you have nothing to fear... Your Majesty.
2120009902/I don't trust her. But we find each other useful...
2120009903/Fine, I'll help you get the edicts.
2120009904/First kind words I've heard around here.
2120009905/Just a pleasant gesture. Take care.
2120009906/What do you say we find a nook somewhere...
2120009907/Seen any recently?
2120009908/Take care.
2120009909/What's wrong, Thaler?
2120009910/But I thought...
2120009911/You believe the seal's fake?
2120009912/You don't fool me, Thaler.
2120009913/Keep your hands off him.
2120009914/Later. I need to do something.
2120009915/You best disappear for a while.
2120009916/I'll hear both sides.
2120009917/So you refuse to help. Wait a minute... what code?
2120009918/Worked out that way, I guess.
2120009919/Nothing I can't handle, thank you.
2120009920/Actually, yes.
2120009921/You forget I'm a simple witcher.
2120009922/I'm still not sure it was smart to tangle with De Wett.
2120009923/None, but thanks for asking.
2120009924/What do you mean?
2120009925/Really?
2120009926/Seems authentic... "During my absence, I entrust you with..."
2120009927/I see. That isn't on the other edicts.
2120009928/So the "royal" edicts are fakes.
2120009929/I'm here about the notice.
2120009930/There you are.
2120009931/That many? I'll return.
2120009932/Here.
2120009933/I don't have them yet.
2120009934/I don't have that many. I'll return soon.
2120009935/You don't seem to have very much work lately...
2120009936/I'll return soon.
2120009937/Here they are.
2120009938/I play. Care for a game?
2120009939/I'll get back to you.
2120009940/Farewell, Velerad.
2120009941/But Salamandra is terrorizing your city...
2120009942/If you detest Salamandra, I have a proposition.
2120009943/The fleder fangs.
2120009944/You wanted to talk.
2120009945/You're not very convincing.
2120009946/You think Salamandra would torch the city?
2120009947/Take care.
2120009948/Who could have stolen the seal from Foltest?
2120009949/I'm listening.
2120009950/Is someone falsifying his royal edicts?
2120009951/I hope you find the traitor. I'll let you know if I learn anything.
2120009952/The ghoul blood.
2120009953/The kikimore claws.
2120009954/10 claws.
2120009955/The graveir bones.
2120009956/I took care of the problem. They're all dead... almost.
2120009957/Unfortunately, their leader escaped.
2120009958/Why?
2120009959/What do you want, De Wett?
2120009960/What edict?
2120009961/And Thaler objects? You're kidding...
2120009962/I'll kill him with pleasure.
2120009963/Thaler walks.
2120009964/I'll hear both sides.
2120009965/I did what I had to.
2120009966/Let's talk about Thaler.
2120009967/Who exactly are you?
2120009968/Farewell.
2120009969/Do you have any proof?
2120009970/Nevertheless...
2120009971/He was an important man, the king must have trusted him...
2120009972/I know that game.
2120009973/Who exactly are you?
2120009974/Interested in anything besides politics?
2120009975/I'll consider it.
2120009976/Like those about the quarantine and the curfew?
2120009977/Farewell.
2120009978/I'll try...
2120009979/I'm doing all I can.
2120009980/Yaevinn sent me to see what happened to you.
2120009981/Meaning?
2120009982/That was worth more than you can imagine.
2120009983/Interesting... we found nothing.
2120009984/How's everything with you?
2120009985/Who would you say I am?
2120009986/Yaevinn, cut to the chase.
2120009987/I'd be interested to hear about Lara.
2120009988/I've powerful friends... who know how to destroy that organization.
2120009989/Who?
2120009990/Yet you're alive...
2120009991/If you're Salamandra's enemy, I may have an offer for you.
2120009992/We'll see.
2120009993/Have any jobs for me?
2120009994/No, but I'm sure you'll tell me.
2120009995/I'll pass...
2120009996/Agreed.
2120009997/You assume correctly.
2120009998/Now you resemble humans...
2120009999/But I feel no contempt for them, I don't look down on them, and I don't generalize. Humans are how they are, and I'll make no effort to change or fight them. I'll adapt. Evolution, Yaevinn.
2120010000/Farewell.
2120010001/You're trying to make the sun stand still. To me, elves hardly differ from humans. I don't understand you, and I don't like your arrogance. You dream of a lost time that will never return no matter how many dh'oine you slay.
2120010002/I'm as much an outcast as you, Yaevinn. I see your point, but have no interest in torching human villages.
2120010003/What are you doing here? Why aren't you with your... elves?
2120010004/What can I do to convince you?
2120010005/I'm not one of your zealots, Yaevinn. Spare me...
2120010006/You don't stand a chance in open battle...
2120010007/Why do you hate humans so much, Yaevinn?
2120010008/I'll see what I can do.
2120010009/I'm sorry but I can't right now.
2120010010/My payment?
2120010011/What's going on?
2120010012/What, boy?
2120010013/I always like a good story.
2120010014/Graverobbers?
2120010015/Mhm.
2120010016/Something to think about.
2120010017/Later.
2120010018/Take care.
2120010019/Thanks for the story. Farewell.
2120010020/The local herbs.
2120010021/Know any tales?
2120010022/I'm here to negotiate.
2120010023/Defend yourself!
2120010024/Meaning?
2120010025/But...
2120010026/Relax, Grouver. I'm here to negotiate.
2120010027/Defend yourself!
2120010028/But...
2120010029/Yes.
2120010030/No.
2120010031/Fine, I'll help.
2120010032/Unfortunately, their leader escaped.
2120010033/They're all dead... almost.
2120010034/Velerad, hurry.
2120010035/Warehouse?
2120010036/Always the hero...
2120010037/Could use it.
2120010038/Is there another way in?
2120010039/I'll help, but I work alone.
2120010040/Give me the key.
2120010041/Just in time.
2120010042/Unused?
2120010043/Let's wait for Siegfried.
2120010044/Strange, I wouldn't think Siegfried would let an opportunity like this slip by...
2120010045/What's happening?
2120010046/I said I would help. What do you want?
2120010047/Out of the question. I'm not about to fight for you.
2120010048/I don't think so.
2120010049/This is no time for poetry...
2120010050/The knights will be here any minute...
2120010051/I don't.
2120010052/Knights upstairs. They'll be here any minute.
2120010053/What do you intend to do?
2120010054/Yaevinn... calm down... you still have a choice.
2120010055/No.
2120010056/No. But I think we have more important things to think about.
2120010057/Be quick.
2120010058/Yaevinn...
2120010059/Knights upstairs. They'll be here any minute.
2120010060/What monsters?
2120010061/All?
2120010062/We needn't be enemies.
2120010063/So?
2120010064/Aelirenn... Hmm... Freedom, beautiful ideal. I'll join you, but remember, Yaevinn - victorious revolutionaries become statesmen, those who are defeated are labeled criminals...
2120010065/I'm not about to slay humans in the name of some vague philosophy. Lay down your arms and maybe you can save what remains of your unit.
2120010066/What decision?
2120010067/I'm here to negotiate.
2120010068/I'll see what I can do.
2120010069/Yaevinn, the bank is surrounded...
2120010070/Were you there?
2120010071/Is your head on straight, Yaevinn? Why would I help you?
2120010072/Are you trying to recruit me?
2120010073/Yaevinn, I've heard enough today about war, about the survival of a race. Picture this - I do not want to get involved.
2120010074/Don't expect me to tag on a squirrel tail and dive headlong into battle. I'll help you the witcher's way.
2120010075/Yaevinn, the knights are preparing to attack...
2120010076/I won't be dragged into a war between the Scoia'tael and the Order. I'm a witcher. Neutral as all hell.
2120010077/I'll clear the passage.
2120010078/All in a day's work. I hope my help doesn't go to waste.
2120010079/It'll be worth your time, I assure you.
2120010080/I have powerful friends... who see a way to destroy that organization.
2120010081/Strange... kikimores outside their nest?
2120010082/Your chance to return the favor, if you're an enemy of Salamandra.
2120010083/Does that mean you'll meet with them?
2120010084/At a tavern in the Trade Quarter, the New Narakort.
2120010085/Good luck, Yaevinn.
2120010086/I thought we were negotiating...
2120010087/Let's go!
2120010088/I need to prepare.
2120010089/Greetings, Siegfried. Shall we negotiate?
2120010090/How do we get in?
2120010091/I've come to pull you out.
2120010092/Got a plan?
2120010093/Velerad sent me.
2120010094/Let's do it.
2120010095/So be it.
2120010096/This can be settled without anyone else getting harmed.
2120010097/Good point. Attack!
2120010098/We're not here to fight, Siegfried.
2120010099/It means 'human,' Siegfried. Yes, we're here to negotiate.
2120010100/You win. Attack!
2120010101/Yes?
2120010102/But...
2120010103/Siegfried?! What are you doing here? You shouldn't...
2120010104/But we expelled him from the bank.
2120010105/You can help me dismantle Salamandra.
2120010106/There's a banquet every evening at the the New Narakort tavern. Come by tonight.
2120010107/Siegfried, we've gone through so much together... you trusted me at the bank...
2120010108/Some other time.
2120010109/I have certain powerful friends... who know how to destroy that organization.
2120010110/Wait for our sign.
2120010111/Let's just get him.
2120010112/You'll get a dog someday. I promise.
2120010113/What shed?
2120010114/Do you want to run off and play pick-up sticks sometime?
2120010115/Mhm. Right.
2120010116/No way.
2120010117/You'll do what you want.
2120010118/I don't know, Alvin.
2120010119/Yes,
2120010120/She must have her reasons...
2120010121/Too much of anything can be harmful..
2120010122/You're getting better at it every day.
2120010123/When you're older, you'll go.
2120010124/Congratulations. Uh, I need to go.
2120010125/Not now...
2120010126/It's late. You should be in bed.
2120010127/We can't have a dog, the way we live.
2120010128/Not now, Alvin.
2120010129/Alvin...
2120010130/Don't worry about it.
2120010131/You've got to learn to control it.
2120010132/Not now, Alvin.
2120010133/Later, Alvin. But you know who can't find out.
2120010134/Next time I'll play, too.
2120010135/Not now, Alvin.
2120010136/Early, late, depends on how you look at it.
2120010137/No, Alvin. Swords are not toys. You'll understand when you're older.
2120010138/Yes, Alvin. They gave me no choice.
2120010139/Everything'll be all right.
2120010140/Shhh...! They're coming. Grab the kid and go out back.
2120010141/Take him to Triss. She's a sorceress. She'll protect him best.
2120010142/Get going!
2120010143/Take him to Shani. She'll know what to do. Triss'll be pissed, but can't worry about that now.
2120010144/Get going!
2120010145/You're right. I am impressed.
2120010146/Dandelion.
2120010147/Shit! That's who I'm here for!
2120010148/I don't want you around when I start swinging.
2120010149/Great. Wait here and don't enter until the fighting stops.
2120010150/She's just... Ah, I don't know anymore...
2120010151/A mercenary dwarf and a wandering troubadour who knows all the loose women in town. I couldn't choose better advisors. Let's go.
2120010152/But...
2120010153/Dandelion, do you always have to butt your nose into...
2120010154/Shani is wonderful...
2120010155/Triss is a fine woman...
2120010156/Yeah, not bad. Incidentally, Zoltan, why are we drinking from tankards? I swear I saw glass in here...
2120010157/Me too. Gentlemen, time to get this show on the road. The ideas are getting dumber by the minute...
2120010158/I get it. Half-measures for Dandelion, though. He yammers enough as it is.
2120010159/You're so full of shit, Dandelion.
2120010160/Ehh, I think you can forget about that...
2120010161/I don't either. It's late. Thanks, gents, for the instructive chat...
2120010162/So be it. Cheers!
2120010163/Not a one. So I don't expect it'll be any different with me. I've accepted that, but no woman ever could.
2120010164/All right, let's go.
2120010165/That's not exactly what I was thinking of. I just want to settle down.
2120010166/Nothing you need to know...
2120010167/You may be right. But honestly, do you see me as a cobbler or a farmer?
2120010168/Somehow I don't think so.
2120010169/And you don't know what you're talking about.
2120010170/She didn't say either way...
2120010171/Don't get excited, Dandelion. I just have my doubts.
2120010172/Hmm...
2120010173/No. ||I wasn't made for that kind of life...
2120010174/That's not the point. The Lady of the Night and her daughters were vampires, I got a contract...
2120010175/I'm a witcher. Ever hear of a witcher who had a family? Do you know why no one knows how long witchers live?
2120010176/Hmmmm....
2120010177/I just don't feel like it.
2120010178/My dissonance is nothing to you.
2120010179/There's no point in speculating...
2120010180/I'll drink to that.
2120010181/Oh, Dandelion, it's not that simple...
2120010182/Highly original, Dandelion.
2120010183/But I'm a witcher, killing monsters is my destiny...
2120010184/I do.||If you only knew how much, Dandelion.
2120010185/Dandelion, we were talking about relationships in case you didn't notice...
2120010186/Damn, I have no idea what happened after we left that tavern... Weren't we going to the Night House?
2120010187/Damn, I don't remember how I got here...
2120010188/It'd be much simpler if you two would just agree.
2120010189/If not for Triss, I'd be dead, most likely.
2120010190/Aah... What brings you here?
2120010191/I have gold.
2120010192/Fine. See you.
2120010193/I though this was a brothel.
2120010194/I don't intend to.
2120010195/I have something for your mistress.
2120010196/What news of him?
2120010197/Do you know one Siegfried of Denesle?
2120010198/Very nearly. I'm Geralt.
2120010199/I meant Siegfried.
2120010200/Where can I find him?
2120010201/Can you tell me why?
2120010202/Hmm... Where is he?
2120010203/You don't know that, so you shouldn't judge, sir.
2120010204/If she is a vampire, I'll have to...
2120010205/I'll do what I can.
2120010206/Of the uh... Flaming Rose?
2120010207/With what?
2120010208/There's a blue-eyed courtesan at the whorehouse.
2120010209/Fang marks don't necessarily mean a vampire.
2120010210/All right. I'll look for your sister.
2120010211/I have proof. I saw fang marks on her neck, just as you described.
2120010212/I have no proof, but this woman matches your description.
2120010213/Maybe.
2120010214/At the brothel. I slew the vampire, so if she wants to, your sister will come back...
2120010215/The vampire's finished - where's my payment?
2120010216/Ah, you people will never change...
2120010217/Farewell.
2120010218/Don't do anything stupid. No one needs to die here.
2120010219/Wait!
2120010220/She's right. There's no spell - your sister chose.
2120010221/I may indeed have dug one, but not for me.
2120010222/Figure this out, the two of you. This is none of my concern.
2120010223/I didn't want to...
2120010224/Aargh...
2120010225/I'm a witcher. Witchers slay monsters.
2120010226/Sad as it is, I remember nothing.
2120010227/It is done.
2120010228/What are you talking about?
2120010229/Forgive me, madame, I lost my memory...
2120010230/Who are you?
2120010231/With empty coin sacks.
2120010232/A vampire haunts this house. The marks on the neck of one of the girls...
2120010233/What are you talking about?
2120010234/The girl's brother believes she would never work in a brothel of her own free will. He believes she must be spellbound...
2120010235/Why the interest?
2120010236/Sadly, I remember nothing...
2120010237/This is nonsense...
2120010238/And if I don't consent?
2120010239/Forgive me, Madame, but I don't understand.
2120010240/I'm here on business.
2120010241/What do I need to do to spend a night with these beauties?
2120010242/You win. I'll leave you be.
2120010243/And the blue-eyed girl?
2120010244/I killed humans... and I should be killing monsters.
2120010245/What now?
2120010246/So there was no spell?
2120010247/And the girl?
2120010248/You mentioned times past. Could you tell me about your man?
2120010249/Witchers slay monsters, vampire. Nothing personal.
2120010250/Take care.
2120010251/Greetings, blue-eyed one.
2120010252/What do you dream of, Blue Eyes?
2120010253/How much? Couldn't we arrange a better deal?
2120010254/I must be mistaken.
2120010255/I'd like to spend the evening with you.
2120010256/I preferred 500.
2120010257/No way.
2120010258/Not knights on white steeds and other nonsense...?
2120010259/I think your brother may be looking for you.
2120010260/What an interesting scar on your neck.
2120010261/It adds character. Intriguing.
2120010262/She was a vampire, a post-conjunction relic...
2120010263/You don't have to sell yourself. Go back to your brother.
2120010264/I don't kill humans...
2120010265/I wanted to experience this fantasy of mine...
2120010266/The vampire's dead. Your brother awaits at the New Narakort.
2120010267/You sure?
2120010268/Yes. Go back to your brother. Given what happened here, customers aren't likely to come back any time soon.
2120010269/I wanted to start out talking.
2120010270/Never mind. Take care.
2120010271/You don't understand...
2120010272/I had no choice. Your brother...
2120010273/Your brother is dead.
2120010274/No regrets?
2120010275/He'll torment you no more.
2120010276/The mirror delighted Alina. Yet she believes herself alive and is preparing to marry.
2120010277/Did you post this notice?
2120010278/Harn the mason sent me.
2120010279/Exactly.
2120010280/Where is the harness?
2120010281/Why don't you live in the village?
2120010282/Where is the griggs' crypt?
2120010283/With the question: "Who's the fairest of them all?" I know Nehallenias's Mirrors come in two varieties, polite and broken.
2120010284/How will I know they did?
2120010285/At night, griggs destroy the bridge Harn must then repair in daytime.
2120010286/I have the griggs' treasure.
2120010287/Then I'm off to hunt devourers.
2120010288/Abigail, remember the cave...?
2120010289/Take care.
2120010290/How do you know this?
2120010291/Dandelion will be perfect for that.
2120010292/You haven't changed a bit...
2120010293/I'll try.
2120010294/I need your help on a matter of a... spiritual nature.
2120010295/I don't know how to send Alina's spirit into the beyond.
2120010296/Any way to help them reconcile?
2120010297/Thanks, Abigail.
2120010298/Greetings, Abigail. You've found a new home.
2120010299/Remind me. What am I supposed to do now?
2120010300/Are you kidding? No matter. Thanks.
2120010301/Cat harness...?!
2120010302/Here they are.
2120010303/And if they hate it?
2120010304/Treasure?
2120010305/Bye.
2120010306/Any elves around?
2120010307/A maneuver?
2120010308/Ask Dandelion, the poet. Supposedly, he's pretty good.
2120010309/Yes, but I must make sure Alina is safe - I'll go find her.
2120010310/Enough! Speak no more...
2120010311/I seek Alina, Julian's fiancée.
2120010312/Typical elves. Farewell.
2120010313/Like a fox. Can I ask you something?
2120010314/How's your poem?
2120010315/The groom's nervous. He asked me to find her...
2120010316/What is it?
2120010317/A princess once said: a mouse in a cu... No matter.
2120010318/Are they peaceful?
2120010319/Geralt.
2120010320/You're in love with Alina? You know she's getting married...
2120010321/I succeeded in sending Alina's soul... somewhere.
2120010322/Farewell.
2120010323/Sheath your dagger.
2120010324/Would you like to help Alina?
2120010325/Adam, you look dreadful...
2120010326/I don't like that look...
2120010327/Farewell.
2120010328/Celina killed her sister?
2120010329/You're not a bad man and... you can change.
2120010330/Alina is not dead. She turned into a noonwraith.
2120010331/An accident.
2120010332/Try not to do anything stupid...
2120010333/Adam, NO!
2120010334/She can only hear poets and the dead. And you're no poet...
2120010335/Sorry.
2120010336/If you can help Alina, do so. I'll explain to Julian somehow.
2120010337/What's the knife for?
2120010338/Not exactly.
2120010339/Romantic, indeed.
2120010340/Dandelion, I'm sure, described my profession realistically.
2120010341/Greetings. I'm Geralt the witcher...
2120010342/Can I speak to Alvin?
2120010343/Has Alvin been behaving strangely?
2120010344/What did he say?
2120010345/Mhm.
2120010346/Romantic, I know. I'll find him.
2120010347/Thanks.
2120010348/How heartwarming...
2120010349/You taking care of Alvin?
2120010350/I'm looking for Alvin.
2120010351/Farewell.
2120010352/Thanks.
2120010353/Your fiancé's spending time at the inn?
2120010354/Arguing already?
2120010355/I see.
2120010356/Ah, women...
2120010357/I saw Julian and Celina together, but don't get bent out of shape. Celina's starved for attention, Julian didn't seem really interested.
2120010358/Mhm.
2120010359/You like it here...
2120010360/Alvin!
2120010361/Go on.
2120010362/Why were you playing by the river?
2120010363/I believe you.
2120010364/It's all right. Let's see...
2120010365/What drew you to these ruins?
2120010366/Alvin, fighting monsters is very dangerous. Promise you'll avoid it whenever possible.
2120010367/I have a gift for you. You like this dimeritium necklace?
2120010368/Mhm...
2120010369/How did you get to Murky Waters?
2120010370/Yeah, Triss is good at taking care of herself. Don't worry about her.
2120010371/Do you have the necklace?
2120010372/Do you want to live with Alina and Julian?
2120010373/Put on the necklace.
2120010374/You needn't tell me...
2120010375/What happened next?
2120010376/Do you still have nightmares?
2120010377/They're just bad dreams, Alvin.
2120010378/I can imagine...
2120010379/Right... Did they hurt her?
2120010380/Alvin...
2120010381/Be good. I'll see you later.
2120010382/Shani's good at that, I feel sorry for the Salamanders. But go on.
2120010383/You should stop playing "Kill the elf."
2120010384/What happened then?
2120010385/Boy, I really need to talk to you and Alina.
2120010386/We'll talk later.
2120010387/This'll keep your nightmares at bay... I wear one, too.
2120010388/Everything's all right.
2120010389/They've lost their lofty, beautiful veneer. One can clearly see the deep hatred they hold for humans.
2120010390/I've got to talk to Toruviel. Stay here.
2120010391/They're fighting for their freedom, for an ideal. Humans have them up against the wall and they see no other way...
2120010392/The elves refuse to concede that the world has changed. They cannot win but still they fight. It's their sad, desperate attempt at halting evolution.
2120010393/Patience, Alvin. It's all right.
2120010394/Do you have the necklace?
2120010395/You all right?
2120010396/I can't help you.
2120010397/Farewell.
2120010398/What do you mean?
2120010399/Claws?
2120010400/I'll keep my fingers crossed, kid.
2120010401/How did you get here?
2120010402/Do you like living here?
2120010403/Don't digress...
2120010404/Spare me the sarcasm.
2120010405/Berengar?
2120010406/Why are you telling me this?
2120010407/I don't intend to judge you...
2120010408/You mentioned an imperfection in my defense.
2120010409/Know where I can find the friendly vodyan priest?
2120010410/Watch it, here they come again!
2120010411/I heard you're attempting to resolve the conflict between humans and the vodyanoi.
2120010412/You're out of your mind...
2120010413/What contract?
2120010414/I don't intend to discuss swordplay. What do you know about Salamandra?
2120010415/I don't think so.
2120010416/Think I can't?
2120010417/I can hear them coming. Get ready...
2120010418/Can we talk?
2120010419/So you worked with Salamandra after all?
2120010420/I've been looking for you, Berengar. For some time. I have some questions.
2120010421/Do I sense envy?
2120010422/I don't advise this, you can't win...
2120010423/Have it your way...
2120010424/Cut the crap. Know how to deal with a noonwraith or not?
2120010425/I dunno. But I don't want to fight you.
2120010426/No.
2120010427/Berengar, I'm not about to get killed by a few bruxae, if that's what you were hoping for. Let's talk...
2120010428/I hadn't intended to. I was thinking...
2120010429/I'll do that.
2120010430/Enough, traitor. I don't hear remorse, all I hear is self-pity. You hate what the witchers did to you, all right. But you joined a group that subjects children to experiments, with mutagens... Get out of my sight.
2120010431/Know anyone who could tell me more about the armor?
2120010432/Thanks. You're not completely useless.
2120010433/Possibly...
2120010434/You mentioned a suit of armor...
2120010435/Farewell.
2120010436/Do what you think is right. I'm not your nanny...
2120010437/A legendary suit of armor... I should do some treasure hunting.
2120010438/Shit!
2120010439/Listen, I have a problem with a noonwraith.
2120010440/Then I have just one request... Stay away from Alvin.
2120010441/She spoke about destiny.
2120010442/No choice, unfortunately.
2120010443/Farewell.
2120010444/I'm not here to tell you I'm any better than you.
2120010445/What...
2120010446/Care to tell me?
2120010447/So, you know nothing more about the attack on Kaer Morhen, about the stolen witchers' formulae?
2120010448/Why?
2120010449/Finally.
2120010450/I'd best start at the beginning. What's your connection to Salamandra?
2120010451/I have the distinct feeling you're not telling me everything...
2120010452/What about the noonwraith?
2120010453/Thanks...
2120010454/I see.
2120010455/I can't condone your choices, but I guess I understand...
2120010456/Tell me.
2120010457/Sounds interesting.
2120010458/Have you spoken with the Lady of the Lake?
2120010459/Don't worry. You'll find a good husband.
2120010460/I have the ring.
2120010461/I'd like to talk to you.
2120010462/Calm yourself.
2120010463/All right...
2120010464/Is your sister happy about getting married?
2120010465/Doesn't sound good. May I ask a question?
2120010466/Farewell.
2120010467/I'm looking for Alina. Have you seen her?
2120010468/Greetings. You look sad.
2120010469/But...
2120010470/Why are you here?
2120010471/Farewell.
2120010472/Need help?
2120010473/Try doing something else. Guerilla warfare can be dangerous.
2120010474/A game of dice, then?
2120010475/Try doing something else. Guerilla warfare can be dangerous.
2120010476/I see. Care to play dice?
2120010477/Drivel. Stop picking berries and do something constructive.
2120010478/It's been some time...
2120010479/Hard times.
2120010480/Chireadan?
2120010481/Any plans?
2120010482/You may still go.
2120010483/There's always a choice.
2120010484/Nothing yet. Is it still valid?
2120010485/Know where I can find the friendly vodyan priest?
2120010486/I killed the fish-man.
2120010487/I'll have a talk with him.
2120010488/I wanted to talk to you about the vodyanoi.
2120010489/Business?
2120010490/The cemetaur from the crypt.
2120010491/How are things between you and the vodyanoi? Everything all right?
2120010492/That's not quite true, but... Listen, got any jobs for a witcher?
2120010493/Uh, I have some bad news for you.
2120010494/Any reward for these creatures?
2120010495/Tell me more.
2120010496/How so?
2120010497/I'm looking for Alina.
2120010498/Farewell.
2120010499/I heard there's going to be a wedding.
2120010500/Any work for a witcher?
2120010501/Geralt of Rivia - witcher.
2120010502/I see.
2120010503/I can imagine...
2120010504/You think Adam a fool?
2120010505/Alina and Celina are dead. Celina accidentally killed Alina. Adam was then blinded by rage and slew Celina.
2120010506/Any nonhumans around here?
2120010507/Hello.
2120010508/Huh-huh yourself.
2120010509/Meaning?
2120010510/Any dice players around?
2120010511/You heard right.
2120010512/Geralt of Rivia - witcher.
2120010513/Five alp teeth, as stated.
2120010514/I see.
2120010515/I'm here about the notice.
2120010516/Inhabited by the vodyanoi?
2120010517/They get along with humans?
2120010518/Thanks.
2120010519/All right, I'll talk to her. Later.
2120010520/I think I know what you mean. I saw some nasty-looking vodyanoi on the shore. Did they drive the priest away?
2120010521/I negotiated a peace between the humans and the vodyanoi. I also defeated Dagon.
2120010522/Nothing to say again?
2120010523/Come now, before I decide you're a grumpy boob and a dimwit...
2120010524/Well, you're welcome anyway.
2120010525/Care to try? A short, magic word, I know you can do it...
2120010526/Take care.
2120010527/I'm looking for a vodyan priest.
2120010528/Well, I hope they haven't scared him off for good.
2120010529/I handled something similar once. I can help.
2120010530/I see. The lake's safe. While we're talking...
2120010531/The city might be submerged. Am I right?
2120010532/I shouldn't keep a godess waiting. Farewell.
2120010533/Listen, I'm having trouble getting the humans and the vodyanoi to agree.
2120010534/Amphisbaenas? Dragonflies? Water creepers? No?
2120010535/Greetings, you're the Fisher King... right?
2120010536/Hmm... Well, I have a professional interest in the area. You see, I'm a witcher. Any monsters in the lake?
2120010537/The mirage of a beautiful city appeared by the lake.
2120010538/Could I use your boat?
2120010539/All right, I'll try to guess. The Lady of the Lake wants to see me?
2120010540/I have no idea what you want.
2120010541/You think the Lady of the Lake could help?
2120010542/You look like you want to say something.
2120010543/I'd like to get a letter to Vizima.
2120010544/So I guess I should talk to representatives of both communities. Later.
2120010545/Love?
2120010546/Let's play poker!
2120010547/Meaning?
2120010548/Die, monster!
2120010549/What?!
2120010550/Got carried away.
2120010551/What's keeping you here?
2120010552/Should I toss for you?
2120010553/Leave.
2120010554/A game?
2120010555/What is it, ghost?
2120010556/Is a game worth coming back for?
2120010557/You don't stand a chance.
2120010558/I'm not interested. Move away.
2120010559/Let's play.
2120010560/Leave him alone.
2120010561/Alvin, step away. Summoned ghosts can be very dangerous.
2120010562/Is the shore safe?
2120010563/Take care.
2120010564/What's happened here recently?
2120010565/What is this place?
2120010566/You do know a lot.
2120010567/Like what?
2120010568/Clever.
2120010569/That's lucky.
2120010570/The vodyanoi priest has returned? I must speak with him.
2120010571/I'm completely lost.
2120010572/She really likes Julian.
2120010573/Perhaps...
2120010574/Right...
2120010575/I saw a city.
2120010576/Undeniably.
2120010577/Clever girl.
2120010578/Do you know who I am?
2120010579/I'm losing track.
2120010580/Need a witcher?
2120010581/What's the problem?
2120010582/All right.
2120010583/How long will the repairs take?
2120010584/A month? For a few small cracks...?
2120010585/Where would I find the witch?
2120010586/Hmm, sure.
2120010587/Farewell.
2120010588/How about talking to them?
2120010589/Why do you think the griggs are your troublemakers?
2120010590/I must go.
2120010591/How can I help?
2120010592/It doesn't look uncrossable...
2120010593/I could use your son's help.
2120010594/Explain my choices again.
2120010595/The book about specters.
2120010596/I prefer gold.
2120010597/They won't bother you while you wear this four-leaf clover.
2120010598/Let's trade.
2120010599/I made a deal with the griggs.
2120010600/My help will cost you.
2120010601/Thank you.
2120010602/Yes.
2120010603/Thanks for the warning. Need a witcher?
2120010604/I won't interrupt again.
2120010605/All three? Isn't that a bit much?
2120010606/And she married a king, priest, mage, warrior? Right? No thanks.
2120010607/Is that all?
2120010608/Anything else?
2120010609/It was nothing.
2120010610/Spacious tavern...
2120010611/Maybe later.
2120010612/Farewell.
2120010613/I'd like to rent a room.
2120010614/Not funny.
2120010615/You must know some interesting stories.
2120010616/Hmm... no matter.
2120010617/I'll find it...
2120010618/What artifact?
2120010619/I sense you haven't told all.
2120010620/What happened?
2120010621/I saw your notice.
2120010622/I meant no offense.
2120010623/Any interesting news?
2120010624/You look sad. Can I help?
2120010625/Where's the village mayor?
2120010626/Not funny.
2120010627/One thing.
2120010628/I'll bring you back as many as I can.
2120010629/Truly tragic.
2120010630/Here're three.
2120010631/I have nothing against slaying humans.
2120010632/So, what will the new ballad be about?
2120010633/The mirror didn't help. Alina is still floating around the fields.
2120010634/Asking, "Who's the fairest of them all?" Nehalennia's Mirrors are either polite or broken...
2120010635/The dead.
2120010636/Try me.
2120010637/Triss? Hand it over.
2120010638/Dandelion, I can't trust you to do anything.
2120010639/I'd have to agree... So, tell me about this place... in prose, if you don't mind.
2120010640/What happened in Vizima after I disappeared?
2120010641/Sometimes killing is necessary.
2120010642/How do I get the letter off?
2120010643/Don't provoke her and no jokes. She's dangerous.
2120010644/Maybe I can describe what's happening here in Murky Waters.
2120010645/Uh, what?
2120010646/By teleport...
2120010647/Spare me your inspirations in the future.
2120010648/She did that for you? Must be having an off day.
2120010649/And I can ask her to notify Foltest immediately of Adda's doings.
2120010650/A corpse.
2120010651/I wanted to answer that letter.
2120010652/Dandelion, I need to figure out how to help Alina's ghost pass on...
2120010653/You have until sunset. Meet in the fields before dusk.
2120010654/A noonwraith?
2120010655/A noonwraith?
2120010656/A ghost.
2120010657/... we find the pieces, reassemble the mirror, and show it to Alina...
2120010658/The deceased.
2120010659/Dandelion...
2120010660/Not anymore.
2120010661/Alina.
2120010662/A package?
2120010663/Let's say she saved me from the kiss of death.
2120010664/Aim to write about peasants working the fields? Dandelion, I know you better than that...
2120010665/Maybe, "Kindest Friend!"
2120010666/Maybe, "Kindest Friend!"
2120010667/Salamanders and their kind deserve to die.
2120010668/Dandelion, care to explain why...
2120010669/I need your help.
2120010670/Anything else?
2120010671/Our Alvin?
2120010672/I don't want to talk about it. Now what? Something about Alvin?
2120010673/How's the poem?
2120010674/Dandelion, something specific?
2120010675/One problem. As a nightwraith, Celina only appears after dark...
2120010676/No, Alina knows who she is, but she refuses to accept her death. How can I persuade her...?
2120010677/Shani? Hand it over.
2120010678/Celina sounds better. Never mind! Concentrate. You can compose a ballad later...
2120010679/Dandelion.
2120010680/Yeah, lovely. I was thinking: people say art and magic are kin, right? So why don't we try poetry to keep Alina around until her sister arrives at dusk. I need you to write a poem.
2120010681/Hmm... All right: "Dearest Shani."
2120010682/Dice? I've played. Didn't think the game was popular in the provinces.
2120010683/Bonehead.
2120010684/I'll believe it when I see it.
2120010685/And the story?
2120010686/Uhhh...
2120010687/Mhm.
2120010688/How do you like the country?
2120010689/I need a poem, a ballad.
2120010690/I doubt I'll find anyone who's a challenge.
2120010691/Hmm... All right: "Dearest Triss."
2120010692/See you.
2120010693/I'll play a bit, then.
2120010694/Death, Dandelion. Alina is dead and her spirit roams the fields in daytime. Somehow, we have to get her to understand that she's no longer among the living.
2120010695/Quit pouting, Dandelion. What do you have for me?
2120010696/Is Alvin in the village?
2120010697/I'm practically a professional.
2120010698/I found Alvin.
2120010699/Too late, you'll have to improvise.
2120010700/I do.
2120010701/I sense we haven't seen the worst of them yet.
2120010702/I will.
2120010703/I only kill humans in self-defense.
2120010704/Wait here. I'll try talking to Alvin.
2120010705/I spoke with Rayla. She's leading the knights of the Order.
2120010706/Vizima it is, then.
2120010707/Alvin opened a portal and disappeared. He could be anywhere...
2120010708/Let's go.
2120010709/I need to talk to White Rayla and Toruviel. Somehow I doubt this will be easy...
2120010710/Dandelion, things have gone from bad to worse.
2120010711/I know. I'll try negotiating with them.
2120010712/Dandelion.
2120010713/I'll find you later.
2120010714/This is bad, really bad.
2120010715/Berengar... I have his confession. It contains some clues that could be important.
2120010716/You're raving, Dandelion.
2120010717/We haven't finished with Salamandra. Azar Javed, the mage who attacked Kaer Morhen, is somewhere in Vizima...
2120010718/I've decided. Care to help?
2120010719/No, I intend to help the knights.
2120010720/Find the Fisher King and tell him to be ready. We're going back to Vizima.
2120010721/Exactly.
2120010722/No, the elves need my help.
2120010723/I'm not worried about that. I'd rather save Alvin, but if I go, there could a massacre. And I have friends to think about.
2120010724/Alina's soul found peace. Celina... well, there was no way I could help her.
2120010725/I did what I could for Alina.
2120010726/Alina's bridal wreath.
2120010727/I don't know how to help Alina's soul pass on.
2120010728/Adam killed her. He was in love with Alina, lost control of himself and "killed" Celina.
2120010729/How did Celina die? Hmm... I'm not sure. She also turned into a demon.
2120010730/It's not that simple. I need more time.
2120010731/I need to speak with Adam if I am to save Alina.
2120010732/You mean cheap.
2120010733/What's up?
2120010734/Now it's your turn to meet your obligations.
2120010735/You know not what you ask. For the time being, I'll keep an eye on him.
2120010736/I'll think about it.
2120010737/Tell me the story of your grandfather.
2120010738/Another witcher? Who? Where is he?
2120010739/I'll do it.
2120010740/Celina killed her, probably by accident... She's dead, too.
2120010741/I'll try.
2120010742/Mhm. I'll do what I can to help the sisters' souls pass on.
2120010743/A-hem. I'll think about it. For the time being, I gave him a necklace that blocks his abilities.
2120010744/I wanted to ask about Alvin.
2120010745/I see...
2120010746/Peace and prosperity take sacrifice.
2120010747/No.
2120010748/That must've been a while back... I'm Geralt.
2120010749/Any work for a witcher?
2120010750/An agreement with the vodyanoi is possible.
2120010751/What happened?
2120010752/Not yet.
2120010753/It's done.
2120010754/Farewell.
2120010755/I was supposed to find Alina.
2120010756/I was supposed to slay Dagon...
2120010757/I've taken Berengar's job, decided to handle this problem myself.
2120010758/I see.
2120010759/Yes.
2120010760/That's rare. Usually people treat me like a leper.
2120010761/Well...
2120010762/Thanks. We'll talk again about the vodyanoi. I need to speak with Berengar first. Farewell.
2120010763/I'll come and see you if I find any more.
2120010764/Thank you. I'll go see him.
2120010765/That is the will of the Lady of the Lake. Care to take issue?
2120010766/Interesting...
2120010767/Play dice?
2120010768/I have 3 hides.
2120010769/Anyone ask about me?
2120010770/I know how to send Alina's soul away.
2120010771/I don't have that much.
2120010772/It'll be more than a silver penny...
2120010773/I don't have an answer to that question. But I'll do what I can to help the sisters' souls depart in peace.
2120010774/Alina's soul rests in peace. Adam unfortunately committed suicide. I have yet to figure out a way to help Celina's soul.
2120010775/I know it's hard, but we can't leave this as it is. People will start dying in the fields if I don't do anything about this.
2120010776/In that case, I'll need something that symbolizes your devotion to her and your desire to achieve peace with the vodyanoi.
2120010777/The alabaster figure depicting a young vodyanoi capturing a water elemental.
2120010778/The diamond.
2120010779/We'll talk later.
2120010780/I'm here about the notice.
2120010781/Fine, I'll go look for her.
2120010782/Have you tried talking to the vodyanoi?
2120010783/Sit down and have a drink... Alina is dead. She has turned into a noonwraith, a demon.
2120010784/I'll ask the Fisher King for permission.
2120010785/M'Lady, they say I returned to life, but lost my memory. Can you help me?
2120010786/I do.
2120010787/Who is it, M'Lady?
2120010788/Why the Fisher King?
2120010789/Perhaps.
2120010790/Farewell.
2120010791/Whose blood?
2120010792/I'll fix Alina's mirror and show it to her. The sight of her own reflection should lift the curse...
2120010793/True.
2120010794/Encouraging... I hope all goes well here...
2120010795/M'Lady! I have had a revelation and wish to embark on a mission
2120010796/I killed Dagon.
2120010797/M'Lady, it seems I'm needed in Murky Waters.
2120010798/It's not about who's right. I want them to reconcile.
2120010799/Who are you?
2120010800/M'Lady, where can I find the vodyanoi priest?
2120010801/M'Lady, are these what you wanted?
2120010802/M'Lady, do you approve?
2120010803/Is that uhh... talkative fisherman your servant?
2120010804/I hoped for guidance.
2120010805/Asking: "Who's the fairest of them all?" The Mirrors may be either polite or smashed.
2120010806/M'Lady, I spoke with the vodyanoi priest and Julian.
2120010807/What gift is that?
2120010808/My beliefs defy easy classification. Let's discuss something else.
2120010809/Dandelion will be perfect for that.
2120010810/I assume each side has an informal leader...
2120010811/I'd rather not.
2120010812/I'm sorry. I'll be going...
2120010813/I'm going.
2120010814/I believe in something more.
2120010815/Mermaid?
2120010816/I see.
2120010817/I'll think about it.
2120010818/M'Lady, I...
2120010819/Thank you, M'Lady. I have one more question.
2120010820/Naturally.
2120010821/How can I restore her identity?
2120010822/I am master of my own fate.
2120010823/I see.
2120010824/Destiny brought me here?
2120010825/I'll return soon.
2120010826/I'll remember, M'Lady.
2120010827/Let's speak more.
2120010828/I see.
2120010829/I should warn you Dandelion takes many liberties in his ballads...
2120010830/M'Lady, can I do anything for you?
2120010831/M'Lady, what happened to those hosts in shining armor?
2120010832/The Grail was never found?
2120010833/Soon I will depart. I don't know if I'll find my Grail, but I must...
2120010834/I do understand your sorrow, your solitude... If I can do anything...
2120010835/M'Lady, simple folk... they don't understand...
2120010836/Hmm, I'm no good at this... M'Lady, your wisdom is inferior only to your goodness...
2120010837/I'll speak to Berengar.
2120010838/If you say so.
2120010839/Very well, back to Julian and the priest.
2120010840/I believed it the best choice.
2120010841/A jest.||The hermit helped me come to an understanding...
2120010842/M'Lady, your eyes are like stars glimmering in the night sky...
2120010843/Your ass puts others to shame.
2120010844/...Mission of paramount importance...||I'll bring the hallowed cup to the Fisher King. He will be healed and with him the entire land...
2120010845/But M'Lady, you don't understand...
2120010846/M'Lady, about the Grail...
2120010847/I was mistaken, m'Lady. I'm a witcher, not a knight suited to seek holy relics.
2120010848/Berengar has no interest in destiny.
2120010849/M'Lady, you look pensive.
2120010850/Thank you, M'Lady...
2120010851/I'm working on it.
2120010852/So be it.
2120010853/M'Lady, please tell me how to send the soul of Alina, a noonwraith, into the beyond.
2120010854/The mirror worked... partially. Alina thinks she's alive and plans to marry.
2120010855/What did Sheenazz tell you?
2120010856/So be it.
2120010857/I was supposed to slay Dagon.
2120010858/M'Lady, you assigned me a task...
2120010859/M'Lady...
2120010860/I'll tend to this.
2120010861/I lost my memory...
2120010862/I'll visit him.
2120010863/Forgive me. I don't remember your name.
2120010864/You mentioned woes...
2120010865/Where did you swim?
2120010866/How do I find Zephyr?
2120010867/Who are you?
2120010868/Where do I find the drowners protecting Zephyr?
2120010869/Where's the friendly vodyan priest?
2120010870/I see.
2120010871/Farewell.
2120010872/How can I reach Black Tern Island?
2120010873/What concerns you?
2120010874/Greetings.
2120010875/Who's Zephyr?
2120010876/I'd like to be your life-long patient.
2120010877/Tell me about the rewards.
2120010878/The book about vodyanoi.
2120010879/I'd like the earth rune.
2120010880/It's a deal, then.
2120010881/I have your necklace.
2120010882/I'll search for your necklace.
2120010883/Can you heal me?
2120010884/Sorry, I haven't time to talk.
2120010885/Thank you.
2120010886/And now?
2120010887/He still steals?
2120010888/Great.
2120010889/How are you with a bow?
2120010890/Is only a legend. Let's go hunt some noonwraiths.
2120010891/Good luck.
2120010892/Don't you want to be a builder like your father?
2120010893/I don't want you involved directly in the fight.
2120010894/Ask.
2120010895/Farewell.
2120010896/If you hit hard enough, a mirror works on any beast... But I prefer my sword.
2120010897/Never mind the sir. I'm Geralt.
2120010898/Come with me, boy. Bring your bow.
2120010899/I see.
2120010900/I'll try.
2120010901/Perhaps... but if we were able to lift one curse, I see no reason why we shouldn't...
2120010902/Go in peace, Celina. You have suffered enough.
2120010903/I'd like to help.
2120010904/If I find a way, I'll return.
2120010905/You're a dangerous monster, as you were in life.
2120010906/Celina?
2120010907/Who are you?
2120010908/Who cursed you?
2120010909/Oh, damn this romance...
2120010910/Strange. It's hot as hell.
2120010911/Alina, gaze in the mirror.
2120010912/Take a good look.
2120010913/Ahem...
2120010914/But...
2120010915/Alina, you're dead.
2120010916/...so romantic.
2120010917/Because you're dead, Alina.
2120010918/Ahem.
2120010919/Ahem.
2120010920/Damn this romance...
2120010921/Come, Strawberry...
2120010922/You watch your step too. I'm not some emaciated elf, I can defend myself.
2120010923/No, no units.
2120010924/Threatening me?
2120010925/I'll try to persuade them. Wait until I return.
2120010926/Slaying monsters, nothing unusual.
2120010927/I thought the Order only accepted the devout.
2120010928/Hold off attacking until I get back.
2120010929/I'll talk to the elves. Maybe they'll listen to reason.
2120010930/I won't let you slaughter these peasants.
2120010931/I think I know how this ends...
2120010932/War is cruel. It warps us all, not just elves...
2120010933/Even other nonhumans?
2120010934/Losses will likely run high...
2120010935/Forgive me, but I don't think I've ever heard of yours...
2120010936/I decided to stay out of the fight...
2120010937/The Fisher King's boat is taken.
2120010938/Farewell.
2120010939/I don't think so. But unlike you, I'm certainly no murderer.
2120010940/And I don't care who won. The victors should arrive at any moment...
2120010941/Will you be all right? You're only one woman, after all...
2120010942/The Eternal Fire, if it exists, warms the souls of the knights...
2120010943/Well...
2120010944/I helped the knights, Rayla. The elves are dead. Toruviel escaped and the villagers are in shock. You'd best leave.
2120010945/What happened?
2120010946/I'm glad.
2120010947/Me too.
2120010948/I lost my memory.
2120010949/I'll return soon.
2120010950/Farewell.
2120010951/What can I do?
2120010952/Mhm.
2120010953/You mentioned we met...
2120010954/How many loaves was I supposed to buy?
2120010955/Here, five loaves.
2120010956/I bought bread.
2120010957/Twenty orens only buys four loaves. Here they are.
2120010958/Is there any way I can help?
2120010959/Greetings, elf.
2120010960/Sometimes honor comes from humility. I'm afraid I can't help.
2120010961/Farewell.
2120010962/Release the peasants, then you can kill each other as you please...
2120010963/I'm glad, but...
2120010964/At least let Alvin go.
2120010965/I want to help, but you must release the hostages.
2120010966/You could have left the children alone...
2120010967/Agreed.
2120010968/White Rayla wants you to lay down your arms. She guarantees you a fair trial.
2120010969/I've come to prevent a massacre.
2120010970/The golden calf.
2120010971/I'll take your staff.
2120010972/I'm sorry to hear that.
2120010973/I'm glad to hear it.
2120010974/The gold bracelet.
2120010975/The Lady of the Lake wishes the vodyanoi to live in peace with humans. Killing their favorite cow wouldn't help...
2120010976/The Lady of the Lake wants to help resolve the conflict.
2120010977/Dagon is dead.
2120010978/I need to speak with him. Farewell.
2120010979/Everything all right?
2120010980/Got any work for someone skilled with a sword?
2120010981/Did I hear you right? Another witcher?
2120010982/Thanks.
2120010983/I see...
2120010984/Look, I'm no cowherd, so I don't quite know how to lure the bigbloodbovine...
2120010985/I've taken Berengar's job. Tell me about this conflict.
2120010986/All right, I'll lure the cow to the altar and kill Dagon.
2120010987/I'm supposed to kill it on the altar...
2120010988/I'll think about it.
2120010989/I can take care of that, too. But you'd have to give me something...
2120010990/I saw hostile vodyanoi on the shore.
2120010991/I don't speak your language.
2120010992/Farewell.
2120010993/All right, then. I'm witchmolol bool.
2120010994/So I'm to pay tribute to the Lady of the Lake?
2120010995/Evidently. Let's talk.
2120010996/What's "witcher" in your language?
2120010997/Witchmolol?
2120010998/Fruits and nuts? Those peasants are mad...
2120010999/I kneel before no one.
2120011000/You want me to steal the cow and use it to bait Dagon?
2120011001/And I'm Geralt, pleased to meet you.
2120011002/All right.
2120011003/I'll take the job.
2120011004/I'm not interested.
2120011005/Gladly.
2120011006/No thanks.
2120011007/What about payment?
2120011008/I slay monsters, drowners, kikimores...
2120011009/My stomach is rumbling.
2120011010/Any work for me?
2120011011/You must be an excellent cook.
2120011012/Farewell.
2120011013/Remind me what to do?
2120011014/I have the glimmering dust.
2120011015/What happened?
2120011016/I'm to get rid of the succubus?
2120011017/A wonderful aroma.
2120011018/Any work?
2120011019/Alina loved the mirror. But she doesn't believe she's dead and wants to prepare for her wedding.
2120011020/I see.
2120011021/Grandma, Harn the mason sent me.
2120011022/I meant no offense... May I ask you something?
2120011023/Where's the harness?
2120011024/Why don't you live in the village?
2120011025/Let's try it.
2120011026/Where is the griggs' crypt?
2120011027/How will I know if they did?
2120011028/Harn is troubled by griggs. At night, they destroy the bridge he is trying to repair by day.
2120011029/I have the griggs' treasure.
2120011030/I see.
2120011031/Farewell.
2120011032/How do you know all this?
2120011033/A task for Dandelion.
2120011034/At least business is booming...
2120011035/I'll try.
2120011036/How do I send Alina's spirit into the beyond?
2120011037/Asking the usual - "Who is the fairest of them all?" I know Nehalennia's Mirrors can be distinguished into the courteous and the smashed.
2120011038/What kind of gift?
2120011039/I'm here on business...
2120011040/Remind me what to do.
2120011041/A cat harness...?!
2120011042/And if they don't like it?
2120011043/What?
2120011044/I'll be back with them.
2120011045/Here. I won't ask what you do with them...
2120011046/I'm here about the devourer teeth.
2120011047/Whose blood?
2120011048/Not now. I'll see you later.
2120011049/Sorry, Alvin.
2120011050/Do you think it's fun?
2120011051/Only fools feel no fear...
2120011052/Wouldn't you rather be a knight?
2120011053/It's not true that witchers are never afraid. Besides, none remain who can complete the mutation...
2120011054/We never get sick, but that costs us. And then there's pain... Would you like to hurt badly?
2120011055/No.
2120011056/Your visions are a gift, not a curse. It's up to you to use them for good.
2120011057/Destiny isn't everything. We are masters of our own fate.
2120011058/Keep your gift a secret. The lives of the gifted are rarely easy.
2120011059/I asked you to hide if it turned dangerous.
2120011060/Those people... they're just afraid of what they don't understand...
2120011061/They're dead, Alvin...
2120011062/I do, but that's none of your business.
2120011063/A legend, you say. Maybe I should ask those who know folk wisdom. I promised Julian I'd free his beloved.
2120011064/Hmm, maybe a Nehalennia's Mirror is not enough to break the curse.
2120011065/Me... I don't know...
2120011066/If anything happens, run.
2120011067/How did you get here?
2120011068/You seem comfortable here.
2120011069/Don't you get bored?
2120011070/You must know an abridged version. Say, three theories...
2120011071/Enough genealogy and genetics. I sense that's a false trail...
2120011072/Intriguing.
2120011073/Go on.
2120011074/Do you like her?
2120011075/Anything a witcher can do for you?
2120011076/Any specific instructions associated with this theory?
2120011077/Let's move on to the conspiracy theory. That one sounds interesting.
2120011078/Interesting...
2120011079/Sounds like Dandelion's ballads, only without a love story...
2120011080/I wouldn't mind owning a hut.
2120011081/What can the wreath of immortelles do?
2120011082/What do you know about the Wild Hunt?
2120011083/Hmmm.
2120011084/Asking the usual - "Who is the fairest of them all?" Nehalennia's Mirrors can be distinguished into the courteous and the smashed.
2120011085/So how do I fight him?
2120011086/Yeah, that sounds helpful.
2120011087/Who lies beneath the fifth mound?
2120011088/She ceased attacking me and seems to understand who she is. But she doesn't believe in her own death. She wants to prepare for her wedding...
2120011089/More or less.
2120011090/Alina. She turned into a noonwraith.
2120011091/I gave Alina the mirror.
2120011092/Thanks. Farewell.
2120011093/Thank you.
2120011094/Tell me the classic theory.
2120011095/I'll take the vampire book.
2120011096/How do I handle him?
2120011097/Remind me what to do?
2120011098/I have dealt with the Hunt. What would you like me to do?
2120011099/I can do that.
2120011100/Thank you.
2120011101/What are you suggesting?
2120011102/Enough of this conspiracy talk. Tell me the classic theory.
2120011103/Who lies beneath the kurgans I saw before your hermitage?
2120011104/You play dice?
2120011105/Why does the Lady of the Lake seem skeptical about the search for the Holy Grail?
2120011106/The conspiracy theory sounds interesting.
2120011107/Tell me again about the rewards.
2120011108/Can I ask you something?
2120011109/The wreath of immortelles.
2120011110/The wreath of immortelles.
2120011111/Thank you. I know what to do. I'll find its parts and reassemble the mirror.
2120011112/Not surprising.
2120011113/Do you know how to help a ghost enter the realm of the dead?
2120011114/Greetings. My name is Geralt.
2120011115/Would it be forward if I asked what inspired you to seek isolation?
2120011116/I finished the job. The Wild Hunt is gone.
2120011117/I'll think about it.
2120011118/How can I help?
2120011119/By your speech, I assume you're well-educated...
2120011120/Who is the Lady of the Lake?
2120011121/What?
2120011122/The philosophical, mystical one.
2120011123/Go on.
2120011124/Thank you, farewell.
2120011125/But she's a goddess.
2120011126/Do you take care of the kurgans?
2120011127/I heard you're an expert on the legend of the Holy Grail.
2120011128/I might. Let's talk first.
2120011129/Your knowledge could be useful.
2120011130/See you.
2120011131/Maybe he wanted you busy.
2120011132/Why so surprised?
2120011133/Your father?
2120011134/I will.
2120011135/Thanks.
2120011136/I have questions.
2120011137/Greetings.
2120011138/Tell me about Tobias.
2120011139/What's special about this settlement?
2120011140/Farewell.
2120011141/Got any rooms?
2120011142/All right.
2120011143/I'll talk to him anyway.
2120011144/I hoped to hear an interesting story about the city.
2120011145/Did I sense pride?
2120011146/Thanks for the story.
2120011147/An underwater race of rational beings, interesting.
2120011148/Take care.
2120011149/Prize-winning cow?
2120011150/Not griggs?
2120011151/The Underwater City?
2120011152/Logical conclusion.
2120011153/I know the story.
2120011154/I'll pass.
2120011155/Vodyanoi?
2120011156/Tell me about them.
2120011157/Thanks for the advice.
2120011158/Actually my luck varies...
2120011159/So, you like to gamble.
2120011160/Female gamblers are rare.
2120011161/Sure.
2120011162/It's time I was on my way...
2120011163/I see.
2120011164/You could get to know me.
2120011165/What about love?
2120011166/I don't think I'm interested.
2120011167/Monster tales don't interest me.
2120011168/Interesting tale.
2120011169/No. See you.
2120011170/True.
2120011171/Thank you.
2120011172/Are you a gardener?
2120011173/Tell me about these herbs.
2120011174/I hope it rains soon. Farewell.
2120011175/I'm all ears.
2120011176/Farewell.
2120011177/Is the shawl absolutely necessary?
2120011178/Forgive me, I'm busy.
2120011179/In Vizima.
2120011180/Ask.
2120011181/Thank you.
2120011182/Since when is Dandelion interested in herbs?
2120011183/Hmm... awfully selfless of Dandelion. I'll gladly hear about herbs.
2120011184/I must hurry. Take care.
2120011185/I'm content to listen.
2120011186/Yes?
2120011187/Good luck.
2120011188/Let's go.
2120011189/I'm sorry. I really must go.
2120011190/Yes?
2120011191/How... nice.
2120011192/You are.
2120011193/Thanks, I'll be sure to smack any bruxa I meet with garlic and decapitate her right away.
2120011194/What did he say?
2120011195/How do you know what a bruxa is?
2120011196/Farewell.
2120011197/Tell me.
2120011198/Let's take our relationship further.
2120011199/This is a bit fast for me.
2120011200/I'm glad you're pleased. See you.
2120011201/What the hell...
2120011202/Thanks.
2120011203/I'm sorry. I must depart.
2120011204/Farewell.
2120011205/Sounds like a garkain. But garkains have no venom.
2120011206/After devouring an infected corpse, the garkain may've become a carrier. The medics should look into that.
2120011207/Perhaps cadaverine. Yes, I remember... Garkains often feed on carrion.
2120011208/Yes.
2120011209/I'm not a walking perfumery.
2120011210/Yes.
2120011211/What was the beast?
2120011212/I'm busy. Farewell.
2120011213/Any more information?
2120011214/Good luck in love.
2120011215/Sorry to disappoint, but I have no perfume.
2120011216/I'm glad to help. Keep your coin.
2120011217/What the hell.
2120011218/Not interested.
2120011219/Sounds good.
2120011220/Any rooms?
2120011221/I'd like to order.
2120011222/Two innkeepers?
2120011223/As a waitress, you have to talk to strangers.
2120011224/Bye.
2120011225/I'm a stranger.
2120011226/Got me there.
2120011227/Don't believe everything Alvin says.
2120011228/Wherer'd you get that idea?
2120011229/What stopped you?
2120011230/Cemetaur?
2120011231/Ah... boys...
2120011232/Fear not. I leave nyads and rusalkas alone.
2120011233/I don't have time.
2120011234/My sympathies. Take care.
2120011235/Why do you care about rusalkas?
2120011236/Thanks for the tale.
2120011237/Well...
2120011238/Where did the noonwraiths come from?
2120011239/I must hurry. See you.
2120011240/I'm happy to learn more.
2120011241/Tell me more about Ruyter's armor.
2120011242/What do you mean?
2120011243/What are you talking about?
2120011244/I must hurry. Farewell.
2120011245/I'm here for another reason.
2120011246/The smith can tell me more?
2120011247/Not exactly.
2120011248/I've heard.
2120011249/I'm busy.
2120011250/I'd be glad to learn more.
2120011251/Farewell.
2120011252/True, aquatic beasts are too large and hard-shelled, even for witchers.
2120011253/I hope they don't. Farewell.
2120011254/Aquatic beasts rarely creep out onto land.
2120011255/What are you talking about?
2120011256/Interesting story.
2120011257/Thanks. I'll tend to the nightwraiths.
2120011258/Tell me your dreams.
2120011259/Where did these dreams come from?
2120011260/Another time.
2120011261/Tell me more.
2120011262/No problem.
2120011263/Like I said, no problem.
2120011264/I'm sure it'll be useful.
2120011265/I didn't exactly plan it, but thanks. Take care.
2120011266/I need something.
2120011267/What's that?
2120011268/Hmm, I'll leave...
2120011269/Worse?
2120011270/Have any other secret ingredients?
2120011271/You could say that.
2120011272/Can I...
2120011273/Have any sugar dolls?
2120011274/Farewell.
2120011275/You know what witchers do?
2120011276/I've got 20 orens for 5 loaves of bread.
2120011277/What is it?
2120011278/Good, but remember I know little about metallurgy or smithery.
2120011279/Can you tell me about the armor?
2120011280/Tell me about the rewards.
2120011281/I'll help.
2120011282/The gold.
2120011283/Very interesting. About the armor...
2120011284/Sorry, I promised to help your wife.
2120011285/What do you propose?
2120011286/Berengar mentioned you know the legend of Raven.
2120011287/The red meteorite.
2120011288/You asked for help. What did you want me to do?
2120011289/Any suggestions?
2120011290/What will I get in exchange?
2120011291/What do you need?
2120011292/Not interested in parting with your charming demoness?
2120011293/Who might you be?
2120011294/You're rather versatile...
2120011295/Farewell.
2120011296/Hello.
2120011297/Is my mirror ready?
2120011298/I'll think about it.
2120011299/Deal. Take the pieces. I'll pay you when you're done.
2120011300/Can you reassemble a shattered mirror?
2120011301/Here.
2120011302/I don't have enough.
2120011303/A hobby?
2120011304/I see.
2120011305/I gathered some shadow dust.
2120011306/Mhm.
2120011307/No doubt...
2120011308/She is impressive.
2120011309/Later.
2120011310/Hmm.
2120011311/You're a craftsman?
2120011312/Greetings. Who are you?
2120011313/Here.
2120011314/The Lady of the Lake?
2120011315/Not yet.
2120011316/Can you reassemble a shattered mirror?
2120011317/Yes. 100 orens.
2120011318/There are quite a number of you here.
2120011319/I'm here for the mirror.
2120011320/Farewell.
2120011321/I don't have enough.
2120011322/I think I get it.
2120011323/Any trouble from the inhabitants here?
2120011324/Deal. Take these pieces. I'll pay you when you're done.
2120011325/I'll think about it.
2120011326/I'm here about the notice.
2120011327/I'm looking for information on Raven's armor.
2120011328/I'm listening.
2120011329/A beautful story. Do you know if any records of these songs remain?
2120011330/I'll bring meat next time.
2120011331/I've brought food.
2120011332/I don't like to see anyone go hungry.
2120011333/I've brought food.
2120011334/I see.
2120011335/Say no more.
2120011336/Never mind.
2120011337/Calm down. It'll be all right.
2120011338/You elves will never change. You ignore the obvious - a beggar, even when arrogant, remains unimpressive, even ridiculous.
2120011339/I've brought food.
2120011340/I'm not patronizing you. When I went hungry, I received help from unexpected sources.
2120011341/Now I'm angry.
2120011342/Be reasonable. You need food. I want to help...
2120011343/That son of a... ahem. I'm glad you're safe.
2120011344/Let's try...
2120011345/Alvin! Why are you here?
2120011346/To Vizima... that's where I need to go to find Salamandra. Follow me. We'll find a way out of this cave.
2120011347/Ah, old age is no bed of roses.
2120011348/You'll be my next meal!
2120011349/Spare me, I beg you!
2120011350/What a beast! Did you kill it in the swamp?
2120011351/I'm through being kind!
2120011352/Where did I put that?
2120011353/Greetings, son.
2120011354/What was I supposed to do...?
2120011355/I'll cut you up good!
2120011356/I see humans so rarely.
2120011357/Hey!
2120011358/Eh?
2120011359/Huh?
2120011360/No.
2120011361/I'm hungry again.
2120011362/Hit me, sonny.
2120011363/Come to grandpa, son.
2120011364/Fuck off.
2120011365/Hey, son!
2120011366/Am I deceived or is that sonny?
2120011367/You'll make some nice sausage.
2120011368/You're getting old, gramps.
2120011369/*slurp* Nothing beats meat.
2120011370/Enough! I've had enough!
2120011371/Hm, I'm hungry again.
2120011372/Hit me, son.
2120011373/Come to grandpa, son.
2120011374/Enough! I've had enough!
2120011375/Stay where you are!
2120011376/What, scared?
2120011377/You're getting old, gramps.
2120011378/Nothing beats meat.
2120011379/Yes?
2120011380/What're you implying?
2120011381/I don't know anything about that. And children... don't like e'm.
2120011382/Get away before I lose my temper.
2120011383/You're welcome...
2120011384/A storm approaches, son... Beware of lightning.
2120011385/Ah, swords, I suspect I know the type of work you seek. Perhaps you could escort me to the chapel for my prayers? I'm old and no longer good at driving monsters off with my staff.
2120011386/Listen to gramps, son. My joints are stiff - a storm is coming.
2120011387/I truly wonder if you'll succeed.
2120011388/Quiet, lad! I don't peek into your bowl!
2120011389/Uh, not so fast, son. I'm old and not so hearty as you.
2120011390/Ah... Forgive an old man his odd ways, but I need to get home.
2120011391/Hello, son.
2120011392/Heheh. You guessed my name. They call me Gramps around here.
2120011393/People exaggerate. I don't see many scabs, heheh. No offense.
2120011394/Of course. It grows here and there in the swamp, though it's rare. The blossoms are used to make a drug.
2120011395/That's my hut, son. Why do you ask?
2120011396/An ambitious goal, and ambition is key in life. I'm too tired to explain everything, but I like you, son. I had a book about it somewhere. Maybe I'll show it to you sometime.
2120011397/If you grind it with beast fangs and douse the mixture with alcohol, it becomes a perfume.
2120011398/Yes, son?
2120011399/Not now, son.
2120011400/Why does it interest you?
2120011401/I'm too old to run again. I would not deceive you. You've come to the swamp on an important mission. Completing it must be of greater import than one old monster. Mark me. I hold answers to many questions.
2120011402/If you must...
2120011403/That, too.
2120011404/I don't know anything about that. And I don't like children.
2120011405/What do you want, son?
2120011406/Yes.
2120011407/I truly wonder if you'll succeed.
2120011408/You look a bit pale, care to eat something?
2120011409/What're you implying?
2120011410/You asked. I do follow certain rules - for instance, I never consume children.
2120011411/Whoa! You can always kill me but I'm of greater use alive. I have vast knowledge and I know this swamp well. I could be of assistance to you.
2120011412/Veiny and stringy. I believe I tasted it once but in truth I'm unsure it was dwarf meat. To my embarrassment I was forced to fight a drowner for it. The bloody scrap that was my share had little to identify it.
2120011413/As you wish. I'll say no more.
2120011414/No need for sarcasm. Occasionally I'll polish off a druid or a brickmaker. But I especially savor elf meat - its aromatic, naturally infused with the scent of roots and spices.
2120011415/I enjoy it. It has health-giving qualities... and it tastes like chicken. A pound of human flesh provides the equivalent of...
2120011416/Thank you. As a gesture of good will, I grant you a potion recipe.
2120011417/This would be my home.
2120011418/Not now, son.
2120011419/Don't get agitated - listen to my reasons.
2120011420/Get away before I lose my temper.
2120011421/I know nothing more. It was so long ago. I'm old, I don't remember...
2120011422/An ambitious goal, and ambition is key in life. I'm too tired to explain everything, but I like you, son. There is a book in my trunk. Read it and you will know what I know.
2120011423/Nothing. If my senses don't deceive me, a storm approaches, son... heehee...
2120011424/Why does it interest you?
2120011425/You're strong, surrounded by the light of glory. You've known victory and love. Your foundation's firm, you have principles. Though a mutant, your mind and soul are no worse. Your wisdom and understanding will now be tested, heheh.
2120011426/Humans communicate with fishoids by leaving objects on special altars. Each item has symbolic meaning and is read as an intention. The vodyanoi answer in the same manner.
2120011427/I don't know, and I don't care. You would need to speak with one of the worshippers. But brickmakers don't divulge their knowledge to potential blasphemers.
2120011428/Brickmakers pretend to be normal to strangers, yet they conceal their faith. Do you know those dimwits worship fishpeople?
2120011429/Clay pits... This is where those lunatics work.
2120011430/But to worship slime-covered reptiles with bulging eyes? Those vodyanoi can't even talk! You must communicate with them using objects!
2120011431/The hounds feed on carrion, though they rarely scorn fresh meat. I heard 'em howl at night as they hunt in packs.
2120011432/I rarely go near that cave. It's the lair of wild dogs.
2120011433/Folk tell the strangest tales, all varying save for one point...
2120011434/A tale may change your mind. Local legend claims the tomb of a famous Vran warrior lies in the deepest parts of the cavern. Some say a vast treasure lies with him.
2120011435/All who sought the treasure vanished.
2120011436/Were - for they're nearly extinct. I know little about them, not even whether they accumulated treasures.
2120011437/There, on the other bank, stands the famous mage's tower. None have entered since its builder parted from this world.
2120011438/Folk talk, I listen. Sephirot, pillars and all.
2120011439/The tower only opened when the Sephirot were placed on the pillars of the Tree of Life. Plus the Sentry guarded it.
2120011440/Investigating the mystery of life, seeking to animate the inanimate. He created golems, including the greatest of them all - the Sentry.
2120011441/Indeed, the mage was obsessed. Dedicated to his passion, he wanted only those who understood to gain access. I'm not sure what all the Tree of Life business means.
2120011442/There are few. I know only that the Sentry stands in the Golem Burial Ground near the tower.
2120011443/The pillars are positioned throughout the swamp. The doors open when the Sephirot, runic stones, are united with their corresponding pillars.
2120011444/One of the mage's golems. Made of clay, but given the attributes of life. Those wishing to enter the tower must pass the Sentry first.
2120011445/Three Islands they call this place. A plant called celandine flourishes here.
2120011446/I'm no herbalist, but I read much in my youth... For example, two doses of celandine combined with Naezan salts produces a bomb that instills magic fear.
2120011447/Damnable old age... I might remember later....
2120011448/Hoards of bloedzuigers inhabit the swamp. If you can get two doses of their blood, mix it with abomination lymph and echinops spores, you create a potion the druids call Maribor Forest.
2120011449/Oh... I love this place. Smell the ozone? Feel your hair rising? And that gentle tingling on the skin.
2120011450/Who knows? Though in fact, sources must regenerate after they are tapped. A day must pass before they can yield Power again.
2120011451/You need to be trained... like sorcerers are, for instance. Druids also have their ways. I'm surprised you ask. Certainly you were trained to draw Power.
2120011452/Sorcerers use it to cast spells, the Knowing to strengthen their visions. Wizards and village witches also have uses for it. As for you...
2120011453/Roaming the world, you'll happen upon them occasionally. Ordinary folk won't sense them, but those versed in magic draw energy from Places of Power.
2120011454/Your medallion senses magic? No wonder it quivered. We're near a Place of Power.
2120011455/So you are. Then you know the tricks called Signs. Places of Power increase their strength. Though not real magic, Signs have their uses.
2120011456/You mentioned your medallion, so I presume you're no sorcerer. You employ simple tricks instead of practicing the Art? The medallion should help you.
2120011457/Mages, ecologists and druids dispute the nature of Places of Power. They disagree about energy's renewability, nature's corruption. Some say the Power is depleted and must be conserved. Others claim sorcerers have earned the privilege to absorb it and find 'nature's balance' to be a mere catch phrase.
2120011458/You may also infuse your medallion with energy at a Place of Power.
2120011459/Druids perform healing rituals at Places of Power, but I doubt they'd teach you.
2120011460/Now I need to pray in peace.
2120011461/Here we are. Thank you, son.
2120011462/I know, I know. He feared something or someone, spent most of his time near the pits where those village idiots burrow in clay...
2120011463/Not much, son. He wandered about, asking questions and looking like one with a sour stomach.
2120011464/You're a witcher, yes? I met another of your kind recently, but he lacked courtesy. He demanded to know about the Circle of Elements.
2120011465/I like you. Visit me some time. I'll show you my books, serve you some tea and goulash...
2120011466/It's a Place of Power devoted to the element of soil. The druids watch over it - speak to them if you wish to know more.
2120011467/Son, the chapel's in the other direction. We need to turn back.
2120011468/Umm...
2120011469/Mhm.
2120011470/Mhm.
2120011471/Umm...
2120011472/Mmm.
2120011473/Mhm........ Grumpy boob? Dimwit? Because I don't feel the need to talk incessantly? I may not be the most talkative, but a grumpy boob and a dimwit?! That's harsh.
2120011474/Mhm.
2120011475/Mmm.
2120011476/Mhm.
2120011477/Mmm...
2120011478/Uh-huh.
2120011479/Oo, hmph.
2120011480/Mmmm.
2120011481/Mm?
2120011482/Humph.
2120011483/Mhm.
2120011484/Mmmm.
2120011485/Hm?
2120011486/Mhmmmm.
2120011487/Mmm.
2120011488/Oooooo.
2120011489/Mhm.
2120011490/Mhm.
2120011491/Ummm...
2120011492/Hm?
2120011493/Huh.
2120011494/So generous.
2120011495/I care not about war.
2120011496/You here to kill me? Ha! I'm dead already!
2120011497/Help a leprous woman, sir.
2120011498/Haren Brogg might buy that from you.
2120011499/Halt!
2120011500/You bring trouble.
2120011501/Goodness...
2120011502/Old age is no jest.
2120011503/You're getting old, granny.
2120011504/Help!
2120011505/Who do you think you are?
2120011506/How strange.
2120011507/It's drizzling.
2120011508/Oh, now I know why my bones ache.
2120011509/What a downpour!
2120011510/Ha! The neighbors' laundry is getting wet!
2120011511/Have mercy!
2120011512/Why me?
2120011513/What stench?
2120011514/Death draws closer every night.
2120011515/Alms for the poor.
2120011516/You reek of corpses.
2120011517/The gods reward mercy.
2120011518/I never hurt anyone!
2120011519/You stupid?
2120011520/Oh, I'm sopping.
2120011521/Such rain...
2120011522/My bones ache.
2120011523/Help! Mercy!
2120011524/It hurts...
2120011525/I can't get well.
2120011526/Why me?
2120011527/I never hurt a soul!
2120011528/I'm not completely blind yet.
2120011529/I'm all wet.
2120011530/Such rain...
2120011531/My bones ache.
2120011532/Where will they bury me?
2120011533/Please, have mercy!
2120011534/I'm dying, I know it.
2120011535/Oh, it hurts...
2120011536/I hurt no one!
2120011537/Ha ha, fine joke.
2120011538/I'm soaked.
2120011539/Bad pain in my chest.
2120011540/No sense cursing the heavens.
2120011541/I'm getting sicker.
2120011542/Have mercy!
2120011543/Why me?
2120011544/I hardly smell the stench anymore.
2120011545/I hear Death approaching.
2120011546/Alms for the poor.
2120011547/You stink like death.
2120011548/The gods smile on mercy.
2120011549/I never hurt a soul!
2120011550/I don't want that.
2120011551/I'm all wet.
2120011552/Such rain...
2120011553/My bones ache.
2120011554/Where will they bury me?
2120011555/Please, have mercy!
2120011556/I'm dying, I know it.
2120011557/Oh, it hurts...
2120011558/I never hurt a soul!
2120011559/Forgive me, kind sir. That is not what I meant.
2120011560/I'm soaked.
2120011561/Chest pain.
2120011562/No sense cursing the heavens.
2120011563/I'll be even sicker.
2120011564/Help! Mercy!
2120011565/I fear death...
2120011566/Please, have mercy!
2120011567/What was that?
2120011568/Everything is going to the dogs.
2120011569/Don't mock me.
2120011570/I'm all wet.
2120011571/Rain...
2120011572/My bones are killing me.
2120011573/Help! Mercy!
2120011574/It hurts...
2120011575/I'm not going to get well.
2120011576/Why is this happening to me?
2120011577/I never hurt a soul!
2120011578/Don't mock me.
2120011579/I'm all wet.
2120011580/Rain...
2120011581/My bones are killing me.
2120011582/Who are you?!
2120011583/Out! Now!
2120011584/Hrrr... *hic*
2120011585/You bastard! My dear son!! I'll call the guards!
2120011586/Who are you? Get out of my house!
2120011587/Possibly.
2120011588/Nonsense. A ghastly beast exacts revenge.
2120011589/The gods have punished the outskirts with spilt blood and blazing fire.
2120011590/I regret missing it.
2120011591/They say Jacques de Aldersberg's armor glistened bright enough to blind sinners.
2120011592/Did you see the Grand Master?
2120011593/Hmpf! I'll find those eggs myself.
2120011594/Where can I find good eggs??
2120011595/I'll try. Your ideas always show merit.
2120011596/My bones ache...
2120011597/What's he want? Say something.
2120011598/The end is nigh! The likes of you is proof enough. Nothing personal.
2120011599/Where are you going? No one teach you manners?
2120011600/Welcome, dear. Do have a cup and keep an old woman company.
2120011601/Old, grey, and still chasing skirts. You should be ashamed!
2120011602/Welcome, make yourself at home.
2120011603/Get out! Stomping into my home like that!
2120011604/WHAAAT! You're drunk!
2120011605/Out! Don't let me see you again!
2120011606/I know his fame! I've no desire to listen to a crying brat nine months from now!
2120011607/Poor thing... How about some bread with lard as comfort?
2120011608/The Prophet Lebioda said... What was it he said?
2120011609/Upstairs, my prince...
2120011610/Didn't your mother teach you better manners? She'd not forgive herself for raising such a monster.
2120011611/Finally, you're making sense.
2120011612/Hello, precious. Do go upstairs.
2120011613/How he plays the innocent!
2120011614/Go upstairs to that skinny striga. Unless you prefer more experience...?
2120011615/I can't handle this! My heart. Help...
2120011616/Such debauchery under my roof! She hooks herself a musician or something...
2120011617/Ever so modest... Sway that girl away from medicine. She should pray...
2120011618/Will you take pity on the kitty?
2120011619/She's busy cleaning and doesn't have time for vagabonds!
2120011620/It's my birthday. What have you brought? I was admiring those lovely golden gloves...
2120011621/She's busy cleaning and doesn't have time for vagabonds!
2120011622/What's he want? Say something.
2120011623/Poor kitten - her mother can't even afford food for her. I don't dare feed her the medic's food. She'll likely fall sick.
2120011624/Go - just don't be surprised if she stabs you.
2120011625/You can go upstairs. Just don't force yourself on the girl.
2120011626/No need for charm. The girl's busy.
2120011627/You can go upstairs. Just don't force yourself on the girl.
2120011628/Yes. They send you from the hospital? You certainly look ill. Gods are punishing you.
2120011629/Sits in her room entertaining guests and pays next to nothing in rent!
2120011630/The White Frost approaches, I feel it in my bones. You don't know how it is living in a cold house in your old age.
2120011631/They send you from the hospital? You certainly look ill. Gods are punishing you.
2120011632/Holiest Melitele! 'Tis a monastic sign! A monk of the Prophet Lebioda disguised as a witcher!
2120011633/Upstairs, father! Be my guest!
2120011634/I trusted you! To think what you've been doing upstairs! Help....
2120011635/You claim you... don't even want to?!
2120011636/I don't recall inviting you... but come in. I'm not entertaining anybody right now.
2120011637/Stay away! They say someone seeks to kidnap young maidens!
2120011638/I was beautiful in my youth...
2120011639/Who goes there? Let me get through the night!
2120011640/How he charms! Give me some loving care?
2120011641/I know nothing. Lea'e me be.
2120011642/Who goes there? Let me get through the night!
2120011643/Where is my child?!
2120011644/Some bread, m'lord?
2120011645/I only know old fables.
2120011646/My grandchildren like stories of the drowned dead. Like that of the jilted miller's daughter who tied a millstone 'round her neck and plunged into the depths.
2120011647/I have no more tales, ask elsewhere.
2120011648/When someone overcome by passion drowns, they arise as the drowned dead.
2120011649/At night the miller's daughter persecuted the living 'til the Knights of the Flaming Rose sent her to eternal rest.
2120011650/Its knights protect us and ask no reward.
2120011651/This story concerns the Beast's minions.
2120011652/A hunter who bred bloodthirsty bloodhounds was murdered.
2120011653/This evil crime elicited a curse that transformed the bloodhounds into revengeful ghosts.
2120011654/These ghosts called barghests persecuted the murderers until they tore them to pieces.
2120011655/Only then did the barghests depart.
2120011656/I know a werewolf story.
2120011657/Years ago, a man from Vizima visited his beloved at night.
2120011658/One full moon, a wolf bit him by Merchants' Gate.
2120011659/Fur covered the man's skin. He grew wild with rage.
2120011660/Finally, he transformed into a werewolf. He tore his beloved and many militia men to bits.
2120011661/The mayor hired a witcher who determined the cause was a curse. He removed it but never found the caster.
2120011662/That I don't know.
2120011663/Have you heard of fleders?
2120011664/When criminals and godless die, they arise as fleders, or vampyres.
2120011665/They burrow from their graves - suck blood from the living.
2120011666/Those bitten also become vampyres and further spread the disease.
2120011667/To destroy one you must drive a wooden stake through its heart and decapitate it.
2120011668/Smart ass, eh? Damn you!
2120011669/Many animals died from plague. I wonder how I'll feed my children. No time...
2120011670/I have no more tales, ask elsewhere.
2120011671/I don't want to die.
2120011672/I was once beautiful. Want me?
2120011673/Throw us a coin, or give us some food.
2120011674/Damned villagers. I hope they die.
2120011675/I feel death approaching.
2120011676/The King of the Wild Hunt led his retinue.
2120011677/The soul of an evil man, filled with hatred.
2120011678/Phantoms appear in cemeteries, born of a curse. Woe to those who disturb them.
2120011679/An omen of cataclysm. Woe to those the King of the Hunt espies!
2120011680/Alms for the poor?!
2120011681/The specters will claim him and he'll join the Wild Hunt, ever serving the Ghastly King.
2120011682/I beg you, help me!
2120011683/In my hunger I robbed a crypt. I may have disturbed one of those buried there.
2120011684/A spectral cavalcade flowing across the sky...
2120011685/Last night, a phantom said he would take me soon.
2120011686/Damn you!
2120011687/Specters warned me. The Beast is coming for me.
2120011688/I may retch.
2120011689/The stench is everywhere.
2120011690/I despise you all.
2120011691/My legs are covered in manure again.
2120011692/The Beast will come for us.
2120011693/Care to share your wine?
2120011694/All right, I'll leave.
2120011695/One of you filched my knife.
2120011696/Where'd you find the wine?
2120011697/Who's been through my things?
2120011698/May I offer a tale for your kindness?
2120011699/Long ago, a plague ravaged the outskirts. No family escaped Death's touch.
2120011700/Hunger faced those who survived. Many killed each other for mere morsels of food.
2120011701/Cats and dogs were the first to go, then the rats. Finally, the bodies of the deceased began disappearing.
2120011702/And turned into ghouls, monsters stripped of humanity, forever hungering after human flesh.
2120011703/I can teach you to recognize herbs.
2120011704/Legend says white myrtle came from beyond the sea. Its blooms are an excellent wine base.
2120011705/Hellebore is equally common. Its petals are used to make a tonic for insomnia.
2120011706/Balisse is a common fruit bush. Its fruit is poisonous unless soaked in alcohol. Afterwards, it can be used to make medicine.
2120011707/Townsfolk keep medicinal plants in their homes. Wolf's aloe, for instance, has fleshy leaves that draw out disease when applied to a wound.
2120011708/Vizimans cultivate verbena as a medicine, I don't know what for.
2120011709/Wish to know of echinops?
2120011710/Monster plants, echinops erupt wherever a crime has occurred.
2120011711/They may appear on the barrows of the murdered or where victims have secretly been buried.
2120011712/Such places are damned and best avoided.
2120011713/Or a witcher should be hired.
2120011714/The fruit of the berberk can be lethal if wrongly prepared, but its juice assuages the insane.
2120011715/Do you know celandine? Rub it on festering wounds.
2120011716/Few know a blooming variety of beggartick grows in the swamps near Vizima. Beggartick blossoms are a stimulant.
2120011717/I've said all.
2120011718/Sewants, mushrooms resembling field stones, grow in the cave. But since monsters overtook it, I use celandine.
2120011719/I don't talk to strangers.
2120011720/Leave us be!
2120011721/Your kind's not welcome here.
2120011722/You know how to handle women...
2120011723/That's different... What can I tell you about?
2120011724/Not much more to say.
2120011725/My last cow died. The plague hasn't even spared animals.
2120011726/Smell that? Not all corpses were buried.
2120011727/They say abandoned houses became monsters' lairs.
2120011728/I dreamed I burned in a fire!
2120011729/Doesn't the White Gull medicine grant relief? My grandson should die painlessly.
2120011730/Thanks. This elixir may help my grandson die in peace.
2120011731/Wait... The Reverend refused to help, so I stole his ring. Use it well.
2120011732/My grandson is dying of the plague. Will you show him mercy?
2120011733/Julian appears a decent youth.
2120011734/Wandering rogues scared my cat away.
2120011735/You seem kinder than Berengar. You've done much for us!
2120011736/Monster tales interest witchers, yes?
2120011737/My back aches, yet no rain clouds threaten. Will this drought never end?
2120011738/Listen well: beware alps, horrid vompyres with pin-sharp teeth. Quiet as cats -- they creep up on you, then snap go their teeth.
2120011739/I'll share what I know of vampires, but first, have you something to eat?
2120011740/They slink into houses, oft appearing as a black dog, and suck sleepers' blood.
2120011741/One fends off alps with impassioned faith. Sunlight turns them to ash. Alps also flee at the sight of virgins, though difficult to find these days.
2120011742/Thanks. Many days have passed since I ate.
2120011743/Don't you fear lepers?
2120011744/Leprosy rots my flesh - I'll die here.
2120011745/Kind sir, I've not eaten in so long...
2120011746/Begone.
2120011747/Listen to my tale of cemetaurs. It could save your life...
2120011748/Save me!
2120011749/Oh...
2120011750/My old bones...
2120011751/Ugh, I haven't the strength.
2120011752/Disgusting, but luckily it's dead.
2120011753/Don't get killed.
2120011754/Run!
2120011755/What was that supposed to mean?
2120011756/It's drizzling.
2120011757/Everything's wet.
2120011758/It rains and it pours.
2120011759/Hasn't rained hard lately.
2120011760/Freak or not, you may prove useful.
2120011761/Save me.
2120011762/Ohhh...
2120011763/My old bones...
2120011764/Ugh, haven't the strength anymore.
2120011765/How disgusting, yet fortunate it's dead.
2120011766/Don't get killed, white-haired one.
2120011767/Run for your life!
2120011768/Consider me blind?
2120011769/It's drizzling.
2120011770/Everything's gone wet.
2120011771/It rains and it pours.
2120011772/No rain like this in ages.
2120011773/You might yet be helpful.
2120011774/Away! No closer!
2120011775/Save me, people!
2120011776/Hmmm...
2120011777/...lordie, lordie...
2120011778/Old age is no joke.
2120011779/I'm old but I'm not demented.
2120011780/It's drizzling.
2120011781/Now I know why my bones hurt so much.
2120011782/Hasn't rained hard in a while.
2120011783/Ha! The neighbors' laundry is getting wet!
2120011784/Legs? Stupid cow.
2120011785/Speak up!
2120011786/Liquor allays sore throats, frostbite, consumption - all maladies.
2120011787/It'll pass if you rub good liquors into them.
2120011788/The Black Ones could not master us and neither will the plague!
2120011789/What're you staring at? Old age awaits you, too!
2120011790/Were I younger, I'd show you what it means to bed a woman!
2120011791/I get pins and needles in my spine when the weather changes like this.
2120011792/Know a magician who restores youth? Or at least conjures up hemorrhoid ointment?
2120011793/That you, Morka? Come closer, I cannot see you!
2120011794/Heeelp! We're being beaten, robbed, and raped!
2120011795/Speak up. I'm deaf!
2120011796/Welcome. A strapping lad... Were I just a few years younger...
2120011797/Oh yes, she serves at the inn... I worry - she returns to the village alone each night. But what is it you want of me?
2120011798/Gods' honest truth! The tower, clay servants, and swamp are still there. The swamp's your proof!
2120011799/Louder, I'm hard of hearing... Just an old woman I am, but my granddaughter... Rosy cheeks, long tresses of hair, and ti... well, like apples.
2120011800/Back then, that tower housed a mage who made clay golems that worked without rest.
2120011801/People drown in our lake all the time...
2120011802/Once, the mage told his golems to take water to a fishpond then he took to his books. The golems carried water without pause until the fields transformed into a swamp.
2120011803/In olden days, you could find such booze just outside Vizima. Lost my virginity in those pretty green meadows and haystacks back in King Geddes's reign.
2120011804/What's left is to have another drink.
2120011805/Quick as cats, they attack people in swarms.
2120011806/Same old things. Imps peeing in milk, wolves howling at night, bats biting girls. It's the way of things...
2120011807/You know how to make a woman happy. Let me tell you something...
2120011808/Begone!
2120011809/What a shame the swamp surrounds us now.
2120011810/Yet they won't die fully and they attack people... We call them drowners.
2120011811/What? Speak up.
2120011812/Ah... thanks. I haven't sipped good booze in ages.
2120011813/I've talked too much - my throat's a little dry...
2120011814/How would an old, deaf woman know? But I could tell you things...
2120011815/The mage vanished, the clay golems stood still, for they could only obey the wizard. What's left...
2120011816/I'm out of stories. Come back again. I might recall some more.
2120011817/Drunks topple from boats, folk get dropped from walls, others dive and smash their skulls on the bottom...
2120011818/Vesna is asleep... She said you helped her. Thank you.
2120011819/How glad I am that Vesna is all right! She visited me recently.
2120011820/Vesna has been acting strangely of late... Am I to be a great grandmother?
2120011821/My granddaughter is dead... My poor granddaughter...
2120011822/Vesna brought me some delicious wine... She seems to know much about them.
2120011823/Have you seen my granddaughter Vesna?
2120011824/I fear for my granddaughter... She's not home and it's late.
2120011825/Something must have happened to her...
2120011826/I don't blame her... I remember when I was her age...
2120011827/Who will take care of me now? Vesna... My Vesna is no more...
2120011828/Walking down the street, arse swaying, bosoms heaving, playing the grand dame...
2120011829/What brazen whores!
2120011830/When will this plague end?
2120011831/Pray that our homes remain free of the disease.
2120011832/She's no herbalist. She's a trained medic.
2120011833/All the townswomen dress that way. Vizima's a den of debauchery.
2120011834/Born of profligacy!
2120011835/Me? I just sweep around here.
2120011836/A witcher here! Another ill omen!
2120011837/Bandits profit from the lack of guards patrolling.
2120011838/I'm not starving... Just eager for some pork...
2120011839/Why haven't they driven that dwarven blacksmith off?
2120011840/My favorite, at last! A fine wine in exchange.
2120011841/Folk don't want my Beauclair wines... And I long haven't tasted pork...
2120011842/What do you want with us?
2120011843/AAAAGGGGHHHH!!!
2120011844/Where's my husband?
2120011845/I like dwarves. Even courted one once...
2120011846/Please, release me.
2120011847/Thought you were a bandit.
2120011848/My cow needs milking.
2120011849/Delightful... I hope we meet again...
2120011850/You've innocent blood on your hands, so you cannot help Alina's spirit.
2120011851/Take the gold and don't complain.
2120011852/The dead only hear the dead... and poetry. In death, lost souls demonstrate a far greater sensitivity than in life. Poetry should convince her, stopping her long enough to see her damned sister.
2120011853/Don't dawdle!
2120011854/Sure.
2120011855/Haha, I've lived long.
2120011856/Welcome, wanderer...
2120011857/Grey-haired but dim. Witches always live outside their villages.
2120011858/Indeed. Griggs ride cats like humans ride horses. You must go to that crypt and recover the harness. Then I'll tell you what to do next.
2120011859/I'll buy 10 if you have them.
2120011860/You'll find the entrance in the fields. Once inside, look for the santon, then fetch the harness inside it. Then return to me.
2120011861/I can't complain.
2120011862/Dumb as a doorknob, that man! The griggs must be placated, perhaps with a gift.
2120011863/Also, the tavern draws visitors to me. My needs are satisfied.
2120011864/Alina acquired a relatively rare and powerful artifact, a Nehalennia's Mirror. Nehalennia's Mirrors primarily served prophets and oracles for they foretold the future. Alina oft turned to her mirror for advice.
2120011865/What's that, Pops? Be nice or I'll turn you into a toad!
2120011866/In exchange, they'll leave you a gift, something valuable symbolizing friendship or happiness. Give this object to Harn. If he wears the symbol, the griggs will disturb him no more.
2120011867/Another tribe of griggs inhabits the crypt in the field. Truly evil and vicious, that tribe stole our griggs' most prized possession: a cat harness.
2120011868/You must recover their treasure.
2120011869/The blood of Abigail, the soothsayer from the outskirts.
2120011870/The griggs place it in their chapel as a gift to their gods. The chapel itself is a santon, resembling the kind placed at crossroads.
2120011871/Take the cat harness and go to the old bridge. Beside it, you'll find a santon. Leave the harness for the griggs. If they like your gift, they'll leave you something nice in turn.
2120011872/Good luck.
2120011873/The dead only hear the dead. A sacrifice is needed. Do you know who is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice?
2120011874/Come back later.
2120011875/Like everyone. When I was young, they came with flowers... Now they want fortunes, curses, or spells, damn them.
2120011876/Then they'll play a prank on you.
2120011877/What do you want?
2120011878/This one was smashed. You must reassemble the mirror. The sight of the mirror may cure Alina of her curse.
2120011879/Commendable, sonny. Now take the harness to the chapel of our griggs. It's a small red santon by the bridge. Return tomorrow to see if the griggs accepted the gift.
2120011880/Don't mention it. Old women rarely find such generous listeners.
2120011881/You could use an honest job, sonny.
2120011882/A gaspier has appeared by the old tree again. Or maybe it's just a normal ghost?
2120011883/I'd gladly do it... if you bring me something sweet.
2120011884/For example, verbena, or vervain as they call it in Bullsville, has small blossoms and egg-shaped leaves. The blossoms are useful for fighting fevers and for peeing troubles.
2120011885/Come back... with something for my sweet tooth.
2120011886/I meant my wild herbs-- verbena, ribwort, aloe.
2120011887/Bryonia is a poison, though it can also be used to heal. You'll recognize its leaves, similar to ivy.
2120011888/Or the hop plant. It's used to brew beer but also has a calming effect. Pick the hops but beware of diziness.
2120011889/Interested in herbs? Who could have known? I can teach you to recognize some of them.
2120011890/I don't like the idea of fishing treasure from the lake bottom. Neither the Lady nor the vodyanoi will like that.
2120011891/Alvin is a wierd little brat. I really wonder what that lad will grow into.
2120011892/Travelers see us as beggars but we have our honor!
2120011893/My plants will wilt if this drought holds up.
2120011894/Hurry, before that thing crawls out and threatens the city!
2120011895/One of my people... exploded. Then some... thing attacked another of my companions. Only those you see here survived.
2120011896/Slay that thing, whatever it is. You'll be generously rewarded.
2120011897/Yaevinn will pay your price.
2120011898/Thanks and farewell.
2120011899/A witcher... We're lucky you came.
2120011900/Who the hell are you? Didn't I see you speaking to Yaevinn at the camp?
2120011901/Let's leave these nasty sewers.
2120011902/Witcher, you alive?
2120011903/We're after elven artifacts. Got into the temple, but once there, I felt a terrible cold and heard a cry.
2120011904/What are you doing here?!
2120011905/I'm no good at negotiating.
2120011906/Yaevinn's downstairs.
2120011907/Bloede dh'oine! The witcher's led us into a trap! Kill the mutant!
2120011908/What are you doing here?!
2120011909/Bloede dh'oine! The witcher has led us into a trap! Kill the mutant!
2120011910/A knight?! Siegfried himself! To arms!
2120011911/And you never will. He's met his maker, like many in this profession.
2120011912/I can't pay you until you prove you killed at least six.
2120011913/And here I thought fear had gotten the better of you.
2120011914/Wait a moment.
2120011915/Let's dance.
2120011916/A witcher. I thought old Leo Bonhart killed the lot of you...
2120011917/I'm a bounty hunter. Commanding a mercenary unit is a side line. What brings you here?
2120011918/You know where to find me.
2120011919/If I'd known where to look... Who knows? Have to earn my bread somehow.
2120011920/So it seems, but there's something missing... I've probably killed more elves and Salamanders than you've eaten chickens. I think I may be bored.
2120011921/It's old news now. But I know I'll get another chance...
2120011922/Witcher... I thought better of you.
2120011923/Thanks.
2120011924/Aren't you forgetting something? You still owe me 600 orens.
2120011925/Aren't you forgetting something? You still owe me 300 orens.
2120011926/Aren't you forgetting something? You still owe me 900 orens.
2120011927/I need a change, a challenge. Know what I mean?
2120011928/Yes?
2120011929/Good enough. Take these &#13;
2120011930/Quite some time, witcher. Word had it the princess put a large bounty on your head...
2120011931/Only one? I can give you a Samum bomb, nothing more.
2120011932/Good work. One of the Salamanders had an alchemical manual on him. Take it.
2120011933/How many little cousins did you find?
2120011934/About the she-vampires? Got the blood?
2120011935/You've made our lives a lot easier, witcher. Here's your gold.
2120011936/Just what I was counting on, witcherette. Ready?
2120011937/I've no time to talk now.
2120011938/Yaaa...
2120011939/Death to the enemy!
2120011940/Don't kill me!
2120011941/Retreat in formation!
2120011942/No further!
2120011943/Hm.
2120011944/Everyone follow me! Follow me!
2120011945/Enemy in sight!
2120011946/Die!
2120011947/Enemies in sight!
2120011948/Defend yourself!
2120011949/Wasting my time.
2120011950/Good guess. You killed an innocent citizen. I've got a warrant - care to know what a witcher's head is worth?
2120011951/Last thing. Don't overdo it. Next time you might be the victim of a tragic accident. Clear?
2120011952/Go away and don't cause any more trouble.
2120011953/A thousand orens clears you of all charges.
2120011954/Done. The guy was drunk and high on fisstech. Attacked you without reason. You stayed calm, tried to reason with him three times - to no avail. Bad luck that passing cart ran over him. Witnesses confirmed everything. They also said he was a Scoia'tael sympathizer and cheated at dice.
2120011955/I could only tell you if the employer wished me to, but he didn't.
2120011956/But I can tell you what you're being hunted for. The murder of a city guard. Care to know how much a witcher's head goes for?
2120011957/I'll add your medallion to my collection...
2120011958/But I can tell you what you're being hunted for. The murder of an innocent citizen. Care to know how much a witcher's head goes for?
2120011959/A headhunter, like the late Bonhart. Unfortunately, I'm here on business.
2120011960/Greetings, White Wolf. I've been looking for you.
2120011961/Looking to swindle me? You gotta be kidding.
2120011962/I warned you. Gold won't do this time. Show me what you got...
2120011963/Greetings, White Wolf. I've been looking for you.
2120011964/Good guess. You killed a city guard. I've got a warrant - care to know what a witcher's head is worth?
2120011965/No. He slew some witchers - those who riled the peasants. Magic tricks and witchers' reflexes proved useless against him.
2120011966/Wonderful! The title of Royal Jagermeister will be mine. Else... I'll become a mercenary.
2120011967/Finally! Got the hides?
2120011968/I'll be here.
2120011969/Who are you?
2120011970/What is it?
2120011971/Old Leo was a legend. In some ways he was like you. He killed without emotion. Just like you would kill a... a lame drowner...
2120011972/He was the best. Tall, slim, and... One gaze from those empty eyes could break a man.
2120011973/Yes... Take care, witcher.
2120011974/Nor will you again. We all, in this profession, eventually meet someone better than us...
2120011975/Well, well. I thought Leo Bonhart had disposed of your kind...
2120011976/Bounty hunter. What brings you here?
2120011977/I'm too young to die!
2120011978/I'm so hooot...
2120011979/Oo, I hurt.
2120011980/Whoo! Hard day...
2120011981/A little fornication?
2120011982/Spare me! Please!
2120011983/Ah, business slows on rainy days.
2120011984/Out in the rain again.
2120011985/Gods dammit.
2120011986/Aw, when will this rain stop?
2120011987/Like the look of me?
2120011988/You jest?
2120011989/Run, or I'll call the boys!
2120011990/Out or you'll regret it!
2120011991/You can't get it up anyway.
2120011992/Begone!
2120011993/Mommy won't put out, so you come to me instead?
2120011994/Over here!
2120011995/Help!
2120011996/Salamanders are here!
2120011997/Simply a walk, I guess... but I'm flexible.
2120011998/Carmen may have mentioned you...
2120011999/I know somewhere we won't be interrupted.
2120012000/I believe Carmen mentioned you...
2120012001/She also said what you'd bring...
2120012002/I don't wish to talk.
2120012003/You were divine. Now I must get back to work.
2120012004/You jest... I expected necklaces, rings, not this...
2120012005/I can't accept this... We agreed on flowers...
2120012006/What's happening?
2120012007/And made a pretty penny... Do you deserve my favor...?
2120012008/Huge swords...! What about the rest?
2120012009/I'd pay to be with you...
2120012010/How about it? For you, special price.
2120012011/Spend some gold and I'll get wild!
2120012012/I'll give you the world.
2120012013/Why don't I get johns like you?
2120012014/Out or I call the boss!
2120012015/After what you did at the bank... I refuse to consort with elf-lovers.
2120012016/I expected something else-- a necklace, a ring...
2120012017/Won't know pleasure until you've had me...
2120012018/Your golden days are gone.
2120012019/I don't know how princesses imprisoned in towers show their gratitude when they're freed, but I promise you, you won't be disappointed.
2120012020/I fancy fellows with character...
2120012021/I can't accept this... Carmen said you'd bring flowers.
2120012022/A few orens and I'm all yours.
2120012023/I'm not w-w-willing to discuss that with s-s-strangers.
2120012024/E-e-elves? I don't believe I know any e-elves.
2120012025/S-S-Strangers aren't w-w-welcome here. Begone!
2120012026/Come back another time. I'm b-b-busy.
2120012027/You k-k-killed them? Hmm, their friends are likely to return for the g-g-goods. When they arrive, we can blame it on the d-d-drowners...
2120012028/C-c-coleman will pay you.
2120012029/Survival instinct. I'd rather lay low. The Reverend detests this game.
2120012030/N-n-not here! You want to get both of us in trouble?
2120012031/I d-d-didn't say that... They're obviously not of human m-m-make and stink of d-d-devilry. Best ask among d-dwarves - they must know something.
2120012032/I have to make a l-l-living somehow.
2120012033/The R-R-Reverend sent you, I presume?
2120012034/Are they m-mad? D-dangerous for them to come so close to Vizima. If someone were to report it...
2120012035/The c-c-c-customer's always r-r-right.
2120012036/W-W-What good is that if I die the next day? Another of your kind came before you. He gave me no reason to trust w-w-witchers.
2120012037/I heard you were looking for S-S-Salamandra, but if so you're looking for trouble. It's no m-m-matter to me. You have a d-deal.
2120012038/Witcher...
2120012039/Haren Brogg, merchant and middleman, at your service. What brings you here, w-w-witcher?
2120012040/Ask the R-reverend. He'll decide what you sh-should know. But I wouldn't mind them gone.
2120012041/That's what they all s-s-say... So, shall we?
2120012042/Ha! I knew you'd prove a coward, just like the last w-w-witcher.
2120012043/The Eternal F-F-Fire. A gift from the Reverend, I presume.
2120012044/Scoia'tael heads f-f-fetch a high price, w-witcher. But... b-best forget you kn-know that.
2120012045/Hm, I c-c-could probably find something. I need a parcel delivered to Vizima, to a man named Coleman at the Hairy Bear tavern, no questions asked.
2120012046/I'll ask around. M-m-maybe I'll learn s-something.
2120012047/So he's g-g-got you hooked, too? Clever little r-runt. You've no idea w-what you're getting into. W-w-worse than fisstech!
2120012048/Let's say I b-b-believe you, for now.
2120012049/My crates are s-s-safe then? I underestimated you, w-w-witcher. Incidentally, what h-h-happened to the elves?
2120012050/Anything, r-r-really. But in these hard times, I have a rather l-l-limited selection.
2120012051/Here's your g-g-gold. S-salamandra collect tribute from the villagers. Disobey and they s-slit your throat, s-set your house ablaze.
2120012052/W-where? At the river's edge. They creep out of the water after dusk.
2120012053/Scoia'tael -- S-s-squirrels -- young nonhumans, freedom fighters. Those who d-d-deal with them are hanged. B-b-betray me and you'll hang too.
2120012054/W-W-Why don't I b-b-believe you?
2120012055/I do. The d-d-dead emerge from the river at n-night. A ghastly cold blows from the w-w-water, making my flesh crawl. Help me. I'll s-s-spare no exp-p-pense.
2120012056/G-g-greetings to the honorable gentleman.
2120012057/These d-d-damned undead are my concern. They scare customers off and d-d-destroy my crates. And this is a valuable shipment for a special client...
2120012058/B-b-burn the w-w-witch!!
2120012059/Leave me be!
2120012060/D-d-die, you bastard!
2120012061/I'm feeling horny.
2120012062/Kill them all!
2120012063/I'll just kill you!
2120012064/Noooo!
2120012065/Beat it!
2120012066/Stay away.
2120012067/Everyone follow me!
2120012068/I want him dead.
2120012069/Piss on your corpse.
2120012070/Hey there!
2120012071/You bastard!
2120012072/Hey, whitey. Interested?
2120012073/Unforgettable high with this stuff!
2120012074/You kidding?
2120012075/Finally, a solid meal...
2120012076/Get them!
2120012077/Now I'm really angry!
2120012078/I beg you, mercy!
2120012079/Move!
2120012080/I'll gut you, bastard!
2120012081/Stop right there!
2120012082/Heh heh, good one.
2120012083/Follow me, comrades!
2120012084/Get him!
2120012085/Dammit I like this.
2120012086/Fuck.
2120012087/Huh?
2120012088/Die, s-swine!
2120012089/You don't know wh-who you're m-messing with!
2120012090/Take that b-b-back.
2120012091/My boys had a lot to say about y-y-you.
2120012092/What do you w-w-want from me?
2120012093/Sh-sh-she made me a hawker. She p-p-promised herself to me if I helped the S-s-scoia'tael. I detest nonhumans, but I had to t-t-trade with them.
2120012094/B-burn the devil's m-m-mistress!
2120012095/G-g-gold isn't everything. There are principles to abide by.
2120012096/Why listen to him, R-r-reverend? He's a mutant, a f-f-freak, a witcher!
2120012097/Beat it! Or I'll tear your head off!
2120012098/Looking for something?
2120012099/Are you lost?
2120012100/Don't answer a question with a question!
2120012101/Some nerve. This is Ramsmeat's house, and he never spoke of a visiting mutant, so scram!
2120012102/All right, go in.
2120012103/Wanna wager I can take you in a fist fight? Stakes range from 10 to 50 gold pieces.
2120012104/You win. You won't trick me again.
2120012105/You got lucky that time.
2120012106/Ha! I win!
2120012107/Not had enough? I've thrashed you once already.
2120012108/What else do you want?
2120012109/I'm too young to die!
2120012110/Rabble...
2120012111/Ah, life.
2120012112/No one listens to me.
2120012113/Very funny. I'm gonna burst.
2120012114/No, please don't!
2120012115/It's raining.
2120012116/It's raining again.
2120012117/Oh, no use talking about it.
2120012118/It's really raining.
2120012119/My legs just start dancing!
2120012120/Victims in the swamp!
2120012121/Protect yourself from the plague!
2120012122/Night hunter claims another victim!
2120012123/The trade roads are closed! Live chickens - just 3 orens at the merchant Leuvaarden's!
2120012124/To the gallows with the Squirrels!
2120012125/Begone!
2120012126/Anyone who assists the sons of bitches, or who otherwise commits treason 'gainst the Kingdom shall be handed to the hangman and end their life on the gallows.
2120012127/Full of monsters and nonhumans. No wonder people are dying.
2120012128/Everyone's to stay home and bolt their doors at night. A strange beast hunts humans, and drowners creep from the river.
2120012129/King Foltest, and the council recommend we stock up and ration food.
2120012130/Cover your nose and mouth with a piece of flax cloth.
2120012131/Wrap your gob and the plague might not claim you!
2120012132/It means that you'll pass through neither the Castle nor Merchants' gates, and if the plague has you... hospital if you're lucky, cemetery if you're not.
2120012133/A state of quarantine is hereby announced!
2120012134/We've stopped serving customers for now - sorry.

2120012162/Either we're dealing or shove off.
2120012163/I'm in no mood to chat.
2120012164/We'll deal, but keep your hands where I can see them.
2120012165/Listen to you! Mind your business, mutant.
2120012166/Either we deal or we part.
2120012167/Damned if I'll squeal. The city burns. Nonhumans and knights do battle. So I'll not be conversing with a mutated freak.
2120012168/Wanna fight? Got any money?
2120012169/You're weak. Train more.
2120012170/No pain, no gain.
2120012171/Heh heh, I didn't think you'd be that weak.
2120012172/Ouch, ouch... Enough.
2120012173/Lost again... should've known. Here's your gold.
2120012174/Not now...
2120012175/Wanna beating, stranger? We fight for money!
2120012176/Fight someone you can handle, loser.
2120012177/I'll kick your arse and make money doing it.
2120012178/Heh heh, lost a pile of coin, sucker.
2120012179/I don't want a second beating.
2120012180/You win wanderer. Take your coin and leave me be.
2120012181/Let's talk later.
2120012182/Greetings, whitey. Got money? Wanna fight?
2120012183/You've got a lot to learn... some other time.
2120012184/Should be an interesting fight... Ready?
2120012185/You lost what was a beautiful fight, white-haired one.
2120012186/Leave me, I can't keep my arms up.
2120012187/You're not bad... It's no shame losing to the white-haired one.
2120012188/Not now, whitey.
2120012189/Who's this? The famous whitey. Shame not to fight you. You in?
2120012190/You're not as good as they say. Won't fight you anymore.
2120012191/The white-haired one in action!
2120012192/Pfff... Pure bullshit, what they say about you. You're lame.
2120012193/Wagering you was stupid.
2120012194/Beat me good, whitey. A worthy reward.
2120012195/Your fame precedes you.
2120012196/We beat each other for coin.
2120012197/Rules are simple. Punch each other in the face. Last man standing wins.
2120012198/Well...!
2120012199/We're not fighting, cheat.
2120012200/Never liked it...
2120012201/100 orens.
2120012202/You win.
2120012203/Not now.
2120012204/Choose - two flasks of supreme moonshine and a snack to go with them, a ring or cash...
2120012205/Return tomorrow - lose another 25 orens, heh heh!
2120012206/Fat Fred will rearrange your face, just show me your gold.
2120012207/25 orens.
2120012208/You may fight well with swords, but you're wretched at fistfighting...
2120012209/Ah, okay.
2120012210/Die, bastard!
2120012211/Move your arse.
2120012212/Now die!
2120012213/Bastard!
2120012214/No.
2120012215/Booooring.
2120012216/Kill the bastards!
2120012217/I beg you, please, please!
2120012218/Run! Save yourselves!
2120012219/I'm going to kill you, you bastard!
2120012220/Step back.
2120012221/Men, stay close!
2120012222/Kill the bastard!
2120012223/I'm itchin' to slap somebody.
2120012224/Time to die.
2120012225/What's that?
2120012226/You bastard!
2120012227/Forget it.
2120012228/Run!
2120012229/Fucking hell!
2120012230/I feel like hitting someone.
2120012231/Your face is goulash.
2120012232/Uuu... spare my life!
2120012233/I'll hit you.
2120012234/Get your ass out of here.
2120012235/Everybody follow me!
2120012236/Finish him off, boys.
2120012237/Kill them! Spare no one!
2120012238/Having trouble thinking...
2120012239/Not even funny.
2120012240/Nobody's messed with me in a while...
2120012241/What's your problem, whitey?
2120012242/Ooo scared? Soft as butter? C'mon whitey, what you got...
2120012243/You wanna dance the Viziman? Come on, I want to see your hands in the air.
2120012244/What the... you wanna fight or not?
2120012245/Yoo-hoo.
2120012246/You new too? He likely told you to wait like us. Let's have our way with this little chickie...
2120012247/Ooo, little dove, coo us a different tune, hahaha!
2120012248/She is feisty. Say, let's do what we did unto Mikul's girl, Ilsa! What a screamer.
2120012249/So you say! We aim to have our fun and you won't stop us.
2120012250/Pick any wench, but handle carefully - they work under our protection.
2120012251/Looking for snuff? Go by the inn.
2120012252/Shove off!
2120012253/Looking for adventure?
2120012254/Come on, give us some tail.
2120012255/We can do that.
2120012256/Can't wait...
2120012257/Ooo... This shrew needs taming...
2120012258/Relax.
2120012259/I'll defeat you, then thrash that lizard and go free.
2120012260/Bastard! You couldn't have beaten me without your spells.
2120012261/Next time you'll get beaten.
2120012262/Now you know who rules here. The same way shall I best the beast.
2120012263/If your pouch be full, the wealthy part of town. Here, you're more apt to get stabbed than walk away rich.
2120012264/I'll wager your luck excels at dice.
2120012265/I propose an honest game.
2120012266/I'd rather lose to someone worldly than beat an ordinary sort. These farmers only wager cabbages. A hunter once frequented this establishment, but I haven't seen him in ages.
2120012267/He enjoyed high stakes, but was unlucky at dice.
2120012268/I can tell you're well-traveled. It's a true honor to play a man like you.
2120012269/Depends who you play and where.
2120012270/I respect those who take risks.
2120012271/Why do you ask?
2120012272/The garden at Saint Lebioda's Hospital.
2120012273/I won it from... a gardener.
2120012274/Take no offence.
2120012275/If you say so.
2120012276/Leave me be!
2120012277/Shut your trap!
2120012278/I heard serious trouble's brewing.
2120012279/Scram, mongrel!
2120012280/Be nice.
2120012281/Master Leuvaarden requests your company at six in the evening.
2120012282/This is the Night House, the best brothel in Temeria. It's not for vagabonds in leather rags.
2120012283/I'm doomed... come in.
2120012284/We're closed. The Lady of the Night won't see just anyone.
2120012285/PISS OFF!
2120012286/Who do you think you are?!
2120012287/You have something, you say? So go to a brothel and put it to good use. Shove off.
2120012288/You won't bribe me.
2120012289/I fucked a she-elf once.
2120012290/Oh, to drink in the Hairy Bear! But the city gates are closed.
2120012291/Get lost.
2120012292/Who's there?!
2120012293/But you didn't hear that from me.
2120012294/Much better. Who you looking for?
2120012295/I know where he lives, but you didn't hear it from me.
2120012296/As you wish.
2120012297/Why should I care?
2120012298/5 orens.
2120012299/Sharp tongue, good fellow! What can I get ya?
2120012300/Coleman's dirty schemes - parcel's for him.
2120012301/Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find.
2120012302/You did business with him then he disappeared, right?
2120012303/Am I my brother's keeper? Look for him yourself. I'm busy running this place loftily called a tavern.
2120012304/Well, well... Swords on your back, white hair... You run away from a circus?
2120012305/Shoot.
2120012306/Dammit! Whatever you do, don't bet on the boxing. It's rigged. What do you want?
2120012307/Hmm, well... tough. I was hoping you'd learn something.
2120012308/Shame, Coleman's been behaving strangely...
2120012309/Oo, Ramsmeat'll fancy knowing that.
2120012310/You're lucky. His partners often meet with accidents.
2120012311/Bastard! We knew of a leak, but Coleman?
2120012312/We'll reward you for anything you find out.
2120012313/Evenings he collects transports on the dike... If you provide him a service, learn why he needs it done.
2120012314/Gold. Spectators have a laugh, while the boys let off steam. If something goes awry, the dogs get some supper.
2120012315/Ramsmeat set a price on the snitch's head. 500 orens.
2120012316/Common folks' entertainment - two toughs fight, we wager on who wins.
2120012317/Know the Salamanders? They often carry fisstech.
2120012318/She was born a princess who wanted for nothing, had loving parents and a grandmother who was a great queen.
2120012319/She lived in palaces guarded by hundreds of knights. Everyone thought she'd become a powerful queen. But fate had other plans.
2120012320/How can I help?
2120012321/Don't interrupt. You want to hear the story or not?
2120012322/A story about destiny might prove useful, witcher...
2120012323/Everyone's impressed how you sent Alina's spirit to the great beyond.
2120012324/Poor Adam. Ever the romantic...
2120012325/Ahem... Long ago, in a valley far away, lived a girl. She was a true princess, sorceress, and witcheress...
2120012326/Greetings, sir.
2120012327/Sure. A bargain at 7 orens.
2120012328/I'll be back.
2120012329/Perhaps... Crooked Lou and Bucktooth Bo stole a case of best fire water. Return it and a useful artifact is yours.
2120012330/Fate cast her to foreign shores, yet she returned. The worst assassin tailed her, yet she emerged victorious. Agents of all kingdoms pursued her, yet none caught her.
2120012331/Yes?
2120012332/Death followed her - everyone she'd loved had died. Only the witcher and the sorceress denied Death's calling.
2120012333/The mayor's daughters Alina and Celina are dead!
2120012334/She gained a new family at Kaer Morhen, the hold of the witchers. She learned to fight. Yet destiny once again made noise. The lass had magical talent. She was a source. The witchers afeared the uncontrolled power of a source and needed a sorceress to assist them.
2120012335/Your question reminded me of some old games. I couldn't resist.
2120012336/The villagers are wailing - someone stole our prize-winning cow! Pride of the village!
2120012337/There's a big demand for my omelets!
2120012338/When she killed all her enemies and peace descended upon the world, she rejoined the witcher and sorceress, only to have destiny sneer at her again.
2120012339/Sure. I'm an innkeeper.
2120012340/Wonderful! Here's your coin.
2120012341/So the princess who would not rule, the witcheress who fought humans, and the sorceress who cast no spells used her power as a means to leave this world.
2120012342/What? Y'think everything's small in the country?
2120012343/The mayor's liable to die of grief. Julian, the would-be groom, is much aggrieved, too.
2120012344/It was a jest.
2120012345/A peasant unskilled in arms killed the witcher. The sorceress died trying to revive him. The girl could do nothing for she'd disavowed magic.
2120012346/There's a large hut in the village where the mayor spends his time. But he lives in ... another large hut, so....
2120012347/Ah... I need wyvern eggs for my famous omelets.
2120012348/Her name was Cirilla. What's that matter?
2120012349/They say Adam killed Celina when he learned she'd killed Alina.
2120012350/Her parents died. Enemies butchered her grandmother and took the kingdom. Still, the princess survived. Her fate became bound to one particular witcher.
2120012351/She studied arcane magic. The sorceress loved a witcher and the two adopted the girl. She was truly happy and could have become a powerful sorceress...
2120012352/But war broke out and fate separated the family. Aggrieved, the lass disavowed magic and became a huntress, learning to love killing.
2120012353/All but one.
2120012354/A wedding, that's what! The mayor's daughter, Alina, is marrying a townsman called Julian. He's staying here at my inn!
2120012355/Help!
2120012356/Yes?
2120012357/Help!
2120012358/I hope it's important.
2120012359/What is it?
2120012360/Of course, what shall I give you?
2120012361/He worked hard every year to discover that treasure. Initially, many gladly took the jobs he offered and helped. But soon it became clear that grandfather had gone mad, that there was no treasure.
2120012362/We have a serious problem. The Underwater City is the source of the village's wealth.
2120012363/They returned to the valley and the witcher slew the beast. He could not help noticing the wealth laying in that valley, yet he demanded nothing beyond the penny promised him earlier.
2120012364/Grandfather grew to trust him and knew that sooner or later someone or something would come along and want to take his treasure, for the treasure in the valley was immense, Geralt. Diamond deposits that took years to extract...
2120012365/Here it is. It would have fetched a fine price in Vizima, but peace is more important...
2120012366/I see. Do what you can. I'll pay you.
2120012367/Hurry, no fashion lasts forever.
2120012368/Let me have a look... Undamaged, excellent. Here's your reward.
2120012369/Do what needs to be done, witcher... And if you can, make it quick and painless.
2120012370/All these peasants worry about is the disappearance of their favorite cow...
2120012371/He needs a caretaker who is knowledgeable about magic. Neither I nor my future spouse are suited to be his guardian...
2120012372/My fiancée is dead. Slain by her own sister. Bad enough?
2120012373/He's under house arrest, but you can speak with him. Take this key.
2120012374/Dead?
2120012375/Listen, I'm in the middle of planning my wedding. You have no idea how much time it takes. Come back later.
2120012376/I'll buy any basilisk hides you have. Reptile skin shoes are in fashion in Vizima, you know.
2120012377/Ah, it's hard for me to part with it, but an agreement is sacred, the diamond is yours.
2120012378/How?
2120012379/Grandfather, may Melitele watch over his soul, had a plot of land. A piece of a rocky, frozen valley in northern Kovir, and a deserted coalmine with no coal. Grandfather always said that a treasure was concealed in the valley.
2120012380/When he was 47, had rheumatism and a collection of bobolak scalps above his mantle, he was overcome with grief and went outside. He began cursing the heavens, berating all the known gods in the foulest language he knew.
2120012381/I can't think about this... My poor Alina, I'm sure she suffers terribly. Maybe you should get the advice of the knowing, talk to a witch or the Lady of the Lake.
2120012382/Oh, yes. In the olden days... I'm Julian, it's a pleasure.
2120012383/Geralt?
2120012384/Kill Dagon - that's the monster's name. The entire village will be grateful and I'll give you one of my grandfather's diamonds...
2120012385/You know, I believe in reason not in gods, yet I prayed to Melitele that Alina and I would meet again. I had a bad feeling, I repulsed it... I think I need time to accept the thought... that my Alina is dead. Geralt... How did it happen?
2120012386/By all the gods! That's terrible. So much suffering... What did they do to deserve this fate? Geralt, please help them. And I'll make sure Adam is arrested. He must answer for his crime.
2120012387/They became partners. The witcher watched the workers, killed monsters, drove off bandits, and grandfather managed the business. He's a legend in Kovir, and my family is wealthy and respected... That's the whole story.
2120012388/Farewell.
2120012389/That makes no sense, they don't understand our language. Anyway, the underwater ruins are of a human city. We're fully entitled to what's there.
2120012390/No, witcher, I'm no fool...
2120012391/Grandfather regained consciousness, burrowed out of the snow and looked around to see something that would change his life. The entire valley was glimmering strangely, glimmering so beautifully that he nearly didn't see the beast coming towards him with a heavy gait.
2120012392/By all the gods! So much suffering... What did they do to deserve this fate? Geralt, please help them. Do everything that is in your powers.
2120012393/You've been up to mischief, Geralt. A nasty mess. I can try swaying the peasants to your side, but it won't be easy...
2120012394/That's right. We extract antique items from the underwater city. You'd be amazed how much people are willing to pay for them. The fishpeople don't like it. Unfortunately, we've already hired a different witcher...
2120012395/Are you joking?
2120012396/My grandfather's diamond, the sole thing he grabbed as he fled from the monster... I'll miss it. Give it to the Lady of the Lake and let there be peace.
2120012397/A while back a group of our divers went missing. Later we found their boat adrift. Inside... it was slaughter, witcher. Someone cut them to bits.
2120012398/Geralt...
2120012399/You should train him to be a witcher.
2120012400/Have you?
2120012401/Descending form the mountains, he encountered a witcher who agreed to slay the monster in exchange for a silver penny.
2120012402/Grandfather fled, bending over once to pick up a strangely glimmering stone. In short, he escaped.
2120012403/Alina went for a walk in the fields and hasn't returned. I'm losing my mind! Geralt, please help me.
2120012404/His name is Berengar, you'll find him in the crypt. I think he's finally gotten to work.
2120012405/That's wonderful. Is she all right?
2120012406/How is it going with the vodyanoi?
2120012407/Splendid! The fishpeople shouldn't be a problem anymore.
2120012408/Greetings, witcher. I've heard a lot of good things about your kind.
2120012409/Dagon emerges from the water when blood runs down the altar. Fishpeople bleed, too, you know...
2120012410/Another romantic? I've had enough romanticism and romances. I want a normal, happy life with a normal wife and normal children!!!
2120012411/No... Yes, I almost forgot. The Fisher King. I think he wants to see you.
2120012412/All right, that should be enough.
2120012413/We could play some time, though I should warn you I'm a professional.
2120012414/Occasionally. These peasants play insanely often, so I've gotten some practice.
2120012415/Do what's necessary. Come back when it's all over. I don't feel like talking now...
2120012416/Our relations with the vodyanoi have improved thanks to your intervention. Good work!
2120012417/Soon I'll marry the village mayor's daughter, Alina. We're planning our wedding as we speak.
2120012418/Think so?
2120012419/All in all, true. If you demonstrated remorse, paying for the funeral and providing something to the relatives... Say, 500 orens... They're good people, they'll forgive you.
2120012420/How did it happen?
2120012421/The gods answered. There was a terrible rumble and an avalanche descended on the valley.
2120012422/Thank you, Geralt. I'm devastated. I was a happy man just a few days ago. Now.... I don't know, I may go back to Kovir.
2120012423/Thank you!
2120012424/I'm glad to see you!
2120012425/Then we learned the vodyanoi worship a monster that thirsts for human blood. They make bloody sacrifices to it on the island. If you eliminated that monstrosity...
2120012426/Not in my house. When I was a child I heard many tales of a witcher who saved my grandfather's life in exchange for a silver penny...
2120012427/We shall speak later.
2120012428/Vampires once interested me... Unfortunately, I never examined a live, I mean undead, specimen.
2120012429/Geralt...
2120012430/Sorry, Geralt.
2120012431/The scrolls of an elven songmaster. Once again, try the swamp cemetery.
2120012432/Does my favorite witcher have them?
2120012433/Also in the swamp, you'll find an old mine. When inside, look for a stone sensitive to magic.
2120012434/Want the suit of armor or not?
2120012435/Yes?
2120012436/I heard soldiers were fighting a striga, so I came to see Vizima's famous striga-princess. Though not a striga... still interesting...
2120012437/I'm sure you'll manage. You are Geralt of Rivia.
2120012438/Aard, Igni and then Aard again. But reveal this to no one! And of course, we'll need Raven's armor.
2120012439/An interesting legend. A scientist could learn much about gnome technology from it...
2120012440/We'll need the armor of Cobus Ruyter, the scrolls of an elven songmaster, and the magic formula of Agnes de Glanville. All these components lie in the swamp cemetery. You'll also need to unearth the remains of Raven's armor from his grave.
2120012441/If you use the appropriate set of Signs, the stone will reveal a secret passage to the lair of the famous sorceress, Agnes de Glanville.
2120012442/There's no rush. Wraiths aplenty everywhere.
2120012443/To defeat the striga, you must survive a night near her lair. I'd recommend getting weapon greases, especially argentia and Crinfrid Oil. Your famous witchers' Signs will be useful. Yrden will stop the princess briefly should she run amok.
2120012444/Hmmm... tempering, carburizing, forging, power runes, elven songs plus finishes... hmmm... Tomorrow.
2120012445/Hmmm... Yes, but I would need a few baubles.... The armor of Graf Cobus Ruyter, who died at the Battle of Brenna. His armored corpse lies in one of the cemetery crypts.
2120012446/Ahh! Pure pleasure, penetrating the concealed qualities of steel and learning new alchemical compounds...
2120012447/I'll get right to work.
2120012448/Use Aard, Igni and Aard again on a sizeable stone at the old mine to reveal a magic passage. You'll find the formula inside.
2120012449/Yes. Gaze upon a masterpiece! Superior even to the original!
2120012450/Splendid! The Grand Plan is one step closer! Your reward.
2120012451/Finally that monster is dead.
2120012452/Accelerated mutation and experiments on humans is a dirty business.
2120012453/I'll pay these good soldiers to take these remains to my laboratory, and later I'll...
2120012454/Which you guarded for years without succumbing to any of these temptations. Congratulations.
2120012455/Similar. Magic and alchemy accelerates the mutation. The side effects are practically uncontrollable. It's hellishly quick and strong. To know more, I'd have to dissect it.
2120012456/A combination of alchemy, genetics, biology, and black magic. A mutant, like you. I can't wait to have a closer look.
2120012457/Two. Which one do you mean?
2120012458/Beware the monsters who have settled there. When you reach the lair, find a magic formula within a chest. Fetch me this formula and I shall make you the witcher's armor.
2120012459/Of course. And how did it go?
2120012460/The invaluable White Wolf. Your reward.
2120012461/They say a corpse was found at the old chapel there, torn open... The large intestine stretched to its full one and half meters, all six and half meters of the small intestine wrapped around...
2120012462/If the soldiers were wrong... I heard rumors of certain events in the swamp...
2120012463/The soldiers said it came from the swamp cemetery... Take this scroll. It details the formula for a powerful potion that will help if you choose to fight the striga.
2120012464/Slay that monster before it gets the soldiers!
2120012465/Albedo? Yes, this solution...
2120012466/Take that!
2120012467/I'm innocent! Don't hurt me!
2120012468/Never ever challenge an alchemist.
2120012469/That formula needs rethinking...
2120012470/Do I know you? Ah, distractions... Oh, of course, Geralt.
2120012471/Lovely trophy. Aim to distill it or centrifuge it?
2120012472/Might Rubedo be better?
2120012473/Your just deserts!
2120012474/Oh, greetings.
2120012475/You're confusing things.
2120012476/You have alghoul marrow for me?
2120012477/That's likely since I hired him.
2120012478/I don't know who pursued Berengar, but I had nothing to do with it.
2120012479/You think I lead Salamandra? I'll die laughing.
2120012480/Oh, so you believe it's not me?
2120012481/I'm more of a theoretician than a practitioner. I don't know how to cast spells...
2120012482/Right, we can't waste time. When you find that criminal, I'll gladly help. But now, back to work.
2120012483/Hmmm... Sorry, I got lost in thought...
2120012484/You offended me, witcher.
2120012485/Yes, we'll need a thunderstorm. But I have no idea how to make Mother Nature cooperate.
2120012486/Irritating, isn't it? I remember once searching long...
2120012487/No idea, but you'll manage. If you kill the golem, you'll be able to make a rare potion requiring his heart... Here's the formula.
2120012488/You'll find a ferry to take you to the swamp.
2120012489/Come back later.
2120012490/Get lost and don't return!
2120012491/I heard about you at the tavern near Vizima.
2120012492/I need your help again.
2120012493/I'd never do that. Know why?
2120012494/I hired him to investigate the Swamp Tower. I didn't want to scare you but I still have designs on that structure...
2120012495/My competitors for that knowledge might have disposed of Berengar... He left this book with me. You might find it useful.
2120012496/Splendid! Take this gold.
2120012497/Ah, yes... From the Outskirts, right? No matter... Do you have it?
2120012498/I don't actually need it anymore... maybe just to have some stock.
2120012499/Books are the most reliable storage of knowledge.
2120012500/I knew that... Anything more?
2120012501/That would agree with the legends of the Sentry.
2120012502/Sephirot! So the old scrolls are true!
2120012503/We must find all ten Sephirot. I own one of them - Chocc'mah, the Stone of Wisdom.
2120012504/Yes. Near the tower, you'll find a circle of stone obelisks. When you have all ten Sephirot, place them on the obelisks. Ah! So close! What a breakthrough! I'll abolish the theory of those stuffy professors in Oxenfurt! I'll destroy them. Smash them!
2120012505/Sorry. Could you show me these books? I'll make notes for you.
2120012506/Finally! I've waited long for this day!
2120012507/The greatest discovery of my life! Witcher, I must prepare... Know that you fully earned your reward.
2120012508/I'm counting on you, Geralt.
2120012509/Certainly. Ask away, witcher.
2120012510/Alchemists have always sought answers to mystical and philosophical questions. One crucial issue concerns life, gods, reality...
2120012511/Alchemy contends there are ten elements of the Tree of Life - aspects of divinity we are capable of knowing.
2120012512/Yes, the Sephirot are the Words of Creation carved as symbols into ten stones. The channels connecting them are the branches of the Tree of Life.
2120012513/There are ten Sephirot, divine Words of Creation: Keth'aar - Crown, Chocc'mah - Wisdom, Veen'ah - Understanding, Kezath - Love, Ghe'vrath - Power, Tipperath - Compassion, Neh'tza - Victory, 'Oth - Glory, Yesath - Foundation and Maal'kad - Kingdom.
2120012514/Place a lightning rod on the Sentry and wait for a storm.
2120012515/Help me fulfill my life's work! A tower stands in the forest swamp near Old Vizima...
2120012516/Silence, please. Legend says a mage and alchemist built the tower. No princesses or dragons.
2120012517/The mage died ages ago and the tower was forgotten. The Power within it attracted and deformed nearby creatures.
2120012518/Precisely. I want to examine that Source, witcher, and write a dissertation certain to immortalize my name! I'll have access to secrets that have been hidden away in that tower for years! Unfortunately, the tower is locked. I'll pay 1000 orens to whoever helps me get inside.
2120012519/Were it easy, I 'd not need you. Breaking into a powerful mage's lab is complicated. We must gather detailed information on the tower.
2120012520/In the tales and legends recounted by elders and swamp folk. In old books, too. Recorded wisdom is infinitely more reliable.
2120012521/Ransant Alvaro's "The Secret Gates" and an alchemy treatise, "Ain Soph Aur."
2120012522/While you search for these, you can test my newest invention - a crystal that links Places of Power and my workshop. It will allow you to teleport, disintegrating your being into billions of pieces that travel beyond the time-space curve...
2120012523/There is some chance of error, but it's miniscule...
2120012524/To help with my experiments... I had no idea he belonged to a secret organization.
2120012525/He protected me from Salamandra and did other tasks. He risked his life for me and your sarcasm will not change that!
2120012526/If I worked for Salamandra, I would never let myself be linked to Berengar! You offend my intelligence! Go away!
2120012527/A powerful mage who went into hiding would hardly show he's a learned man.
2120012528/Sorcerers often resort to illusion. The Salamandra leader can easily disguise himself. I doubt you'll find him parading around with an amulet around his neck.
2120012529/They'll speak in my favor.
2120012530/I hired him to find Berengar.
2120012531/I had hoped he would manage it. I cannot get inside myself.
2120012532/If we don't secure the knowledge from the tower quickly, Salamandra and Javed will. My studies will grind to a halt.
2120012533/Simply put, yes... My knowledge, while broad, is theoretical.
2120012534/I forgive you. I get paranoid sometimes, too.
2120012535/You're a fool, Geralt!
2120012536/Are you sure?
2120012537/The rogue! What do you intend to do about it?
2120012538/Lure him to a place where the magical aura is unstable. It would be best if this place were surrounded by the opposing element - water...
2120012539/Perhaps you can hire help? There's a detective in town - supposedly good.
2120012540/Yes... Find the Sephirot and place them on the corresponding obelisks. You'll find clues on where to find them in your notes...
2120012541/The Sentry can only be woken if it's near the tower - which it is - and by using a lightning rod.
2120012542/When you have everything, attach the lightning rod to the Sentry. Energy from the lightning bolt will revive the golem.
2120012543/Through the western gate is a dike leading to Old Vizima.
2120012544/Yes, there's a dock in the swamp near the brickmakers' hamlet.
2120012545/Finally, the witcher Geralt answers my call!
2120012546/Enough to ascertain you can handle my task.
2120012547/A grave matter... Something that could prove a milestone in alchemy! Connected to your profession, too.
2120012548/What? Me? Why?
2120012549/That madman draws power from fire. It's the element of chaos, uncontrollable by rational thought, the opposite of the order embodied in the other elements.
2120012550/Ideal. You'd stand a chance there.
2120012551/I hoped you wouldn't discover that.
2120012552/It's why I want you to solve the riddle. Maybe you can also discover what befell Berengar.
2120012553/Hurry. I need it for my solutions.
2120012554/I don't actually need it anymore... but I'll find some use for it.
2120012555/Tell me, quickly!
2120012556/I know a certain dwarf had a copy of "The Secret Gates." The second book, written by an anonymous gnome, was lost long ago and could be hard to find.
2120012557/Hmm...
2120012558/The drawing depicts a man in a crown - a reference to King Herman the Mad?
2120012559/Yes?
2120012560/You're completely wrong.
2120012561/What is it you're after?
2120012562/Get out of my sight, mutant!
2120012563/Listen to the swamp dwellers, too. Folk knowledge, myths and legends are useful, though oral histories can become distorted...
2120012564/Geralt, I've written the important bits in your notes. I fear too much unnecessary knowledge might... confuse you.
2120012565/There you are.
2120012566/Herman used to ascend a tower during storms and insult the gods. A hostile faction carried out a coup by removing the lightning rod from the tower.
2120012567/You'll need a device that attracts and conducts lightning. Put plainly, a solid metal rod. A good smith should be able to forge one for a decent price.
2120012568/Let's see this card. Interesting... Much depends on interpretation, but I think I understand. Alchemists find it easier to understand other alchemists.
2120012569/Be careful. He has great power. You must separate him from its source, the element of fire.
2120012570/What evidence?
2120012571/Thank you, witcher! You saved me... and my laboratory, my beakers, my treasures!
2120012572/Precisely. You look more reasonable than that troglodyte, so you must understand that as an inventor... Watch out!
2120012573/Leave me be! I won't surrender my workshop for all the treasure in the world!
2120012574/Were I not a scientist and were I not certain it was impossible, I'd say this is a mutated hound...
2120012575/Scandalous! This is the third time they've refused to acknowledge the validity of my pass!
2120012576/Visit my shop in Vizima for any ingredients you need for your potions. At a discount!
2120012577/How dare he call our club a band of senile old men?! I'll appeal it in writing!
2120012578/Let's see... Hmm... Unnatural augmentation of muscle tissue... Hm...
2120012579/This is scandalous! They refuse to let me enter! Me, the honorary chairman of the Alchemists, Geomancers, and Pyromancers Club...
2120012580/Not letting me in? The Oxenfurt Inventors' Club must have bribed them!
2120012581/Had you known this would happen, would you have chosen differently?
2120012582/I'm not surprised at your answer - you don't seem like one to look back.
2120012583/Put it behind you and carefully consider your choices. Think things through before you act.
2120012584/None the less, I am grateful to you for the choice you made this time.
2120012585/Hmm... Three ounces of Optima Mater, a drop of mercury solution... Oh, sorry, I got lost in thought...
2120012586/Greetings, I'm Kalkstein, alchemist.
2120012587/It was an incredible experience. I presented my dissertation on... Specific? Conventions aren't meant to be specific!
2120012588/Of course not, but you’re a mutant, a scientifically wrought improvement, something unnatural...
2120012589/Science is like a great river, full of currents, whirls and treacherous shallows. A single raftsman can never know every secret of the river. He must sail to the harbor and share his knowledge with other raftsmen...
2120012590/When I require monster tissue or organs, hm, well I hire a witcher or a hunter...
2120012591/I need that blood for my research!
2120012592/I've sent a message to my friend, another alchemist. He is my only hope... Hopefully he will send me a pass.
2120012593/A witcher? How much would you ask for an opportunity to examine your body?
2120012594/I do. Check the notice I hung outside.
2120012595/If you wish to obtain components yourself, you’ll need books containing drawings and descriptions of ingredients derived from both plants and animals. Peddlers are your other alternative, but they’ll rip you off.
2120012596/Ha! Typically shortsighted! Witcher, alchemy is the mother of all sciences, and do you know why? For it allows us to understand the world! All that surrounds you is none other than the alchemy you strive so dutifully to deride!
2120012597/I see, field work. Hm, Olaf must have some decent vodka or spirit that could serve as an alchemical base.
2120012598/What brings you here?
2120012599/I live in Vizima, but I'm just returning from a great convention of alchemists, pyromancers and geomancers in Oxenfurt. Wonderful city, witcher, a cradle of science...
2120012600/I see, well, hmm... Maybe you can agree to a post mortem, then...?
2120012601/Alchemical processes transpire in your body at all times! They allow you to eat, breathe and excrete. What’s more, they are responsible for your thoughts and feelings! Alchemy is life!
2120012602/All right, fine, though I perceived you as someone who valued reliable knowledge...
2120012603/Ready-made formulae are rare and difficult to acquire, so I encourage you to experiment, modify recipes you already have.
2120012604/Ah, yes... Because of this quarantine I'm losing time in this inn. I have extremely important research waiting! And what am I doing? Sitting in this dump and drinking alcohol... Badly distilled alcohol!
2120012605/Most people underestimate the value of using the empirical method in science.
2120012606/I need that blood for my studies! Be quick about it.
2120012607/Hmm... Science is like a river...Sorry, I got lost in thought.
2120012608/But we’ve only just begun...
2120012609/One cannot shut the mouth of science... But fine, what do you wish to know?
2120012610/You need equipment to obtain the correct distillate. I myself use an atanator coupled with an alembic and equipped additionally with a rectifying column and a copper cooler...
2120012611/Don’t take offense. I’m merely curious.
2120012612/Do you have any?
2120012613/Thank you. They must admit me, they must...
2120012614/Finally, someone worth talking to! Here I thought the locals had no interests beyond their daily concerns...
2120012615/You would be doing a great service to science...
2120012616/All right, all right, I'm sorry.
2120012617/Greetings, witcher.
2120012618/They're constantly moving and acting upon each other! I have yet to confirm it, but I'm working on it.
2120012619/I've a new theory! A milestone in alchemy! Everything is composed of particles so small they can't be seen!
2120012620/Come back later.
2120012621/Hmm. Never tried.
2120012622/Usually, I'd refuse, but I owe you. Let's see... ingredients, check; equipment, check. Come back later, okay?
2120012623/Yes, but... She will administer it at her own risk, once she drops in one of her tears. The potion needs a virgin's tear to work.
2120012624/You said a young maiden. I assumed she wasn't yet married.
2120012625/A virgin's tear is vital. It can't be difficult to find one.
2120012626/Yes?
2120012627/You have alghoul marrow for me?
2120012628/Splendid! Take this gold.
2120012629/Don't dawdle. I need it for my solutions.
2120012630/I don't actually need it anymore... but I'll find some use for it.
2120012631/Ah, yes... From the Outskirts, right? No matter...
2120012632/I don't actually need it anymore... maybe just to have some stock.
2120012633/The greatest discovery of my life! Know that you fully earned your reward.
2120012634/Finally! I've waited so long...
2120012635/You tried cheating destiny. You took an oath, remember?
2120012636/You cannot stop this, witcher. Death follows you!
2120012637/Salamandra means nothing. It was but a particle of chaos, the tool of the madman you just slew.
2120012638/Your past, your destiny, the reasons for your resurrection... All remain unknown.
2120012639/From now on, the soul of Jacques de Aldersberg, whom you knew under another name, belongs to me.
2120012640/I cannot be killed. You can delay your end, but it will come... Let us tend to the one already dead.
2120012641/You've always used them ably to mask uncertainty and fear. I once promised I would follow you.
2120012642/I come for the soul of the man you killed...
2120012643/Let me remind you: "There is death, but there is also choice. I shall not look back. I shall find Salamandra and fulfill my destiny!"
2120012644/You were wrong. I come for the soul of someone whose path often crossed yours, as it was written. You may fight me, but the end will always be the same-- death.
2120012645/We meet again, Wolf. Have you fulfilled your destiny?
2120012646/You've always used them ably to mask uncertainty and fear. I once promised I would follow you.
2120012647/I'm here to collect on that promise!
2120012648/You dare to oppose me? I sense your weakness as your life seeps from your wounds. With every drop, death draws nearer. You stand no chance against me.
2120012649/You aim to kill him anyway.
2120012650/Yield to me...
2120012651/Do your duty.
2120012652/You want to fight me? So be it. Your flight from death ends here. Draw your sword.
2120012653/Do not fight it. Give up to me yet another man you destroyed.
2120012654/You passed through Vizima like a sword through a heart, accusing others, destroying lives, mindful of nothing but your own purpose, to be achieved whatever the means.
2120012655/Reflect on your deeds, witcher.
2120012656/You threw gold to the Scoia'tael, feuling new massacres.
2120012657/You brought death upon Raymond, endangered Shani mindful only of your goals. Chaos followed in your wake.
2120012658/You helped create the foundations for the Order's fanatical reign.
2120012659/The Order, to which you handed power, aims to eradicate all who are not entirely human. What say you to that, mutant?
2120012660/Do not deny it, witcher. You are my greatest champion, a perfect means of destruction. Wherever you walk, death and chaos follow.
2120012661/I stood near you when you arrived at Kaer Morhen, an omen of its downfall.
2120012662/Vizima blazes, the Order and the Scoia'tael bleed Temeria. Does your neutrality not taste bitter?
2120012663/Every one of your decisions brought further devastation, each choice you made led to greater evil.
2120012664/You slaughtered dozens with your witcher's sword.
2120012665/I observed as you judged the villagers of the Outskirts, leaving only blood and fire behind you.
2120012666/Now, as it was years ago... Accept it.
2120012667/How did you feel when your elven friends set fire to Vizima and slaughtered dh'oine?
2120012668/You left Vizima in chaos only to bring destruction upon Murky Waters.
2120012669/Destiny is a double-edged sword. You are one edge; the other is...
2120012670/Aen'drean, va, Saov Leo, tuv'le!!!
2120012671/Hahaha! You doubt destiny?
2120012672/Remember me?
2120012673/I shall ever be on your trail.
2120012674/You will give me what you already have but do not expect. Does that sound familiar?
2120012675/Do you not believe a child marked by destiny will pass through the witcher's trials?
2120012676/You have given me your word. I shall stalk you, but your time has not yet come.
2120012677/I'll follow you, waiting for mistakes.
2120012678/If destiny holds no sway, repeat my statement.
2120012679/If I didn't know, I'd think you speak boldly to mask fear.
2120012680/I'll be waiting, Wolf!
2120012681/We'll meet again.
2120012682/My task is to see Destiny fulfilled.
2120012683/We will meet again, White Wolf.
2120012684/So, know, witcher, that in the future you will surrender unto me the soul of a dear one. It is written. A person both dear and distant, a traveler beyond time.
2120012685/I do still, though "chase" isn't the word...
2120012686/Rightly so. Velerad reacted quickly, sent us in to restore order. Foltest fears more fighting will break out.
2120012687/Greetings, witcher. With the fighting over, what brings you here? I doubt it's ghouls.
2120012688/They were slaughtering each other when we stepped in. We're taming any hotheads that remain about, so if you're looking for trouble, better turn back.
2120012689/Nasty beasts. I'm glad they're dead.
2120012690/You'll see the world, they said...
2120012691/Nothing but war and war...
2120012692/Our Merciful Master won't permit you entrance. He'll send for you.
2120012693/Move on.
2120012694/Attack!
2120012695/I want to live!
2120012696/Fall back!
2120012697/Fall back, immediately!
2120012698/Argh, damn it's hot in this thing.
2120012699/Follow me! Courage!
2120012700/Grab him! That's an order!
2120012701/Semper Fi!
2120012702/Attack!
2120012703/Steel shall ring against steel!
2120012704/You seek to amuse me?
2120012705/Y...yes, but the witcher found the beast...
2120012706/He's dead. Cut down by that godless butcher, the witcher.
2120012707/Sire! Victory! Despite heavy losses, we now control the Trade Quarter.
2120012708/So?
2120012709/That fool wouldn't know which end of a spear to sharpen!
2120012710/It's true!
2120012711/I wouldn't flaunt your weapon. A state of emergency in the quarter has put everyone on edge.
2120012712/Foltest has gone mad, sending elite knights to patrol the streets.
2120012713/You don't look like a regular vagabond, so I'll watch you.
2120012714/When I vowed to protect the king and serve Temeria, I didn't think I would lurk in dark alleys.
2120012715/Haven't I seen you before?
2120012716/You're Geralt of Rivia. I heard about your feats in the outskirts.
2120012717/I saw a spider-like monster tear apart a pharmacist at the Merchants' Gate!
2120012718/One huge son-of-a-bitch, neither crab nor spider. It crept into the street and circled, then devoured a dog.
2120012719/Some bad, some good, but no matter. Beasts have appeared in the quarter. You demonstrated your abilities in the outskirts, so kill those monsters.
2120012720/I was hacking at the beast with my sword. Unlike you, I saw no need to examine it more closely.
2120012721/Nay, enlarge him a thousand times! Give him my mother-in-law's face and wrath, and that's your monster.
2120012722/Imagine a dog eating a spider then vomiting it out. Now, enlarge the spider a hundredfold.
2120012723/Kiki whatever. Yet it differed. The beast I saw didn't throw itself at people at once. It may even have feared them.
2120012724/It's one of those monsters the vendors gossip about.
2120012725/Cease angering me, commoner.
2120012726/The pleasure was mine. Tend to the creatures, whether warriors or not.
2120012727/Whence do these monsters emerge?
2120012728/Don't roam the streets at night. Death lurks beyond every corner.
2120012729/Salamandra is proving to be a nuisance. They ever elude us, almost as if predicting our next move.
2120012730/I command nitwits. The fate of an impoverished knight.
2120012731/Move it!
2120012732/My ancestors sat next to Temerian kings!
2120012733/If I were you, I'd rent a room at the New Narakort tonight. Salamanders and kikimores can be too much, even for a witcher.
2120012734/You face a knight, simpleton.
2120012735/Witcher, a word?
2120012736/Another day wasted patrolling the streets.
2120012737/I would gladly challenge you to a duel, but you are no knight.
2120012738/Nothing to fear. Kikimores bleed, so they can be killed.
2120012739/I think recent events in the swamp drove the monsters into the city.
2120012740/Think a pass can protect you from kikimores? The curfew was not instituted for amusement.
2120012741/I merely wanted to tell you to keep alert, especially at night. Fleders from the Temple Quarter might wander over here.
2120012742/Only that they are odd vampires, none too quick-witted, but deadly nevertheless. They have wings and can descend on their victims like hawks. One blow and your neck is broken.
2120012743/Thanks. You're a good man.
2120012744/This rabble they gave me to command can't tell which end of the halberd is sharp. If we encounter any monsters, there'll be nothing left but the smell of their foot wrappings.
2120012745/What an insult! I, a nobly born knight, am to wander the streets like an ordinary footman?!
2120012746/I broke my vow... I swore on a... heron!
2120012747/Aaargh... Curses, I'm drunk...
2120012748/No sceeene, please... This ring will get you in the House of the Night... haaaalf price...
2120012749/Err... nonsense... Thaler hiiiired me to come incoghnitooo to the feast...
2120012750/Never you mind.
2120012751/The plague's in half the kingdom. And monsters roam the city's streets...
2120012752/No, but they're vigilant.
2120012753/You'd better - traitors taste steel.
2120012754/Yes?
2120012755/Yes?
2120012756/King Foltest has declared martial law in Vizima.
2120012757/Hurry.
2120012758/Okay. Here's the plan:
2120012759/Go and bother somebody else!
2120012760/Are you mad? Get away before they lock you up.
2120012761/Men! TEN-HUT! Forward march!
2120012762/Whaa? Do you want flowers or something?
2120012763/Wait... are you testing me? Hey lads, I think we've got a troublemaker!
2120012764/I should toss you in the dungeon!
2120012765/At midnight, my unit will arrive in the sewers.
2120012766/You're lucky I'm receiving a medal from Princess Adda soon.
2120012767/They have an important guest.
2120012768/I'm kidding. "Three lilies make one."
2120012769/Capture? One need only identify a nonhuman collaborator.
2120012770/Do I look like a sap to you? A terrorist bags twice as much gold as a kikimore...
2120012771/Comrades, the ladder!
2120012772/What?
2120012773/Martial law is in effect. Wartime rules apply.
2120012774/Geralt of Rivia!
2120012775/Give it up!
2120012776/What? Is that a password?
2120012777/We're expecting the Salamanders shortly.
2120012778/We'll watch your back, but only for two hours.
2120012779/For fighting the elven terrorists.
2120012780/I AM NOT YOUR TOUR GUIDE! Scram!
2120012781/I'm a high-ranking officer!
2120012782/You managed to avoid the quarantine and gain official support?!
2120012783/Yes?
2120012784/He is due to be promoted. In fact, he possibly has been already. I don't know, we never speak.
2120012785/A witcher... They said your kind was extinct...
2120012786/He gazed upon me strangely, saying, "Honorable? Perhaps. Honor and faith? Certainly not. We were victorious for they were hungry and poorly armed."
2120012787/He is transformed. Many of the Order perished in the swamp at the hands of the elves. All save him. They say he hid two days within a cow's carcass...
2120012788/He trains recruits in front of the Order's seat, in the Temple Quarter.
2120012789/Whatever happened, surely old Eyck of Denesle, Siegfried's father, wouldn't have fled when faced by elves.
2120012790/It need be said, however, that though he gathered information about the tactics of the Scoia'tael, how does that compare to the stain which the mission left on his honor?
2120012791/He trains recruits in front of the Order's seat, in the Temple Quarter.
2120012792/A bit of blood and he has forgotten all about honor. He should follow his father's example...
2120012793/He is transformed since the swamp. I said to him, "Honorable Siegfried, I congratulate you. Your honor and faith vanquished the pagan rabble."
2120012794/His father? Dead, purportedly torn apart by a manticore...
2120012795/How did this happen...?
2120012796/One day we found her unconscious in bed. Blood trickled from fang marks on her neck. We had no doubts - a vampire!
2120012797/My sister. Will you hear her story?
2120012798/Obtain proof. My family's honor is at stake!
2120012799/These clearly did, for after a time, my sister disappeared. She must have been transformed and then escaped.
2120012800/Above all, I would like you to find her, confirm our suspicions.
2120012801/My sister would never degrade herself so!
2120012802/Witcher... you must help. The vampire clearly haunts the brothel.
2120012803/She must be under some spell... that of the vampire who bit her. Perhaps she too has been transformed.
2120012804/You should have no trouble recognizing her. None can ignore her azure eyes. She is a slim, beautiful blonde.
2120012805/I've had enough of this town. Naught but tricksters and frauds here!
2120012806/Do not anger me further. We shall speak tomorrow.
2120012807/You'll not see a penny until my sister returns home!
2120012808/The vampire concerns me little. Return my sister to me!
2120012809/Where's my sister?
2120012810/I'd rather not reveal my true name... my knightly vows. If you wish, you may call me Patrick de Weyze.
2120012811/Indeed, I'm a member. Perhaps you could lend me some assistance.
2120012812/Indeed.
2120012813/Traitor! I knew I shouldn't trust a witcher!
2120012814/I had you followed. You've consorted with a vampire and you'll die with her!
2120012815/You have proven yourself the stupid one, witcher. Now reap your punishment!
2120012816/Us?! My dear Sister! We are here to save you, to lift this evil spell that binds you.
2120012817/Witcher, you just dug your own grave.
2120012818/He plowed the she-vampire! I knew it! Flaming Rose, attack!
2120012819/You remembered your duties at the last instant, witcher.
2120012820/You nearly buried us! Give thanks you saved my life, for only my gratitude will keep me from recounting what I saw here.
2120012821/You could be hanged for consorting with vampires! Sister, come!
2120012822/Silence, woman! We'll find you a husband who will beat this nonsense from your head!
2120012823/Quickly, let's leave this place.
2120012824/Be damned!
2120012825/You're here, so listen.
2120012826/Finally, you've arrived.
2120012827/Witcher, think again.
2120012828/Shh, witcher. It matters not if you believe in Destiny. With the blade I present you, you will complete your mission.
2120012829/Take this sword as a sign of my favor. Once the blade of a great warrior, it lay in the depths for ages, awaiting your arrival.
2120012830/Go, White Wolf, and do what must be done. May you fulfill your Destiny.
2120012831/Arise a knight.
2120012832/Destiny tore you from death's claws and brought you here from a faraway land beyond the mists.
2120012833/You traveled a long path fraught with danger. You demonstrated courage and goodness. By divine power, I hereby knight you.
2120012834/Destiny will give you no rest. A long road lies ahead. I see death and blood. I see frosty chaos.
2120012835/Kneel, Geralt of Rivia, White Wolf.
2120012836/Face your enemies without fear. Safeguard the helpless. Never lie, even if it means your death. That is your oath.
2120012837/Hosts of knights once defended my honor... but that was long ago. My poor, sickly Fisher King alone remains.
2120012838/Yet you evade my questions. Perhaps this "something more" you speak of requires other than a simple choice between Destiny and free will.
2120012839/Accept this gift from the Lady of the Lake. It will help you fulfill your destiny.
2120012840/You or Berengar. Speak with him. And may one of you take up destiny's thread.
2120012841/But an innocent person perished in the process...
2120012842/Thanks to you and your friends, humans and the vodyanoi of Ys tolerate one another.
2120012843/Destiny has entangled its threads round a witcher. His path leads into a dark future, into sadness and pain. I wish to help him survive.
2120012844/Alina's doubtless was not polite. Do you understand what to do?
2120012845/When the time comes, I shall aid you with a gift.
2120012846/Sheenazz mentioned your intelligence... I invite you to use it. Speak with the vodyanoi chaplain and the human named Julian.
2120012847/Destiny has brought you here. We must speak.
2120012848/You're too old to take offense. Not everyone can master the bedroom...
2120012849/Servant, no. Women on occasion need men. To secure food and protection, naturally.
2120012850/You deserve my esteem, Geralt of Rivia. I herewith knight you. From this day forward, you shall be known as Sir Bonehead!
2120012851/Mysterious and confident... you will regain your identity and achieve your aim.
2120012852/At my altar on the shore, though Dagon's worshippers occasionally drive him away.
2120012853/You think yourself the only, the best, the biggest...
2120012854/By no small miracle, Alina acquired a Nehalennia's Mirror. With it, oracles and prophets could foretell the future. Alina consulted her Mirror quite frequently...
2120012855/You will find clues on the nature of these objects on the statue.
2120012856/They call me the Lady of the Lake.
2120012857/Strong in character, indeed. You will regain your identity.
2120012858/I fault the legend of the Holy Grail. My bold knights, I know not why, determined to embark on a mission.
2120012859/You revealed Alina to herself with a song...
2120012860/The blood of Abigail, a witch from the outskirts.
2120012861/Excellent. If not, I'll tell you how to resolve the matter completely.
2120012862/Then you're no longer Sir Bonehead, but you know not how much you have lost...
2120012863/With innocent blood on your hands, you cannot help Alina.
2120012864/I expected gifts from both humans and vodyanoi.
2120012865/Geralt, I'm warning you...
2120012866/I am a goddess, you are the sword of destiny. Death has followed you for years.
2120012867/You sent a troubled soul into the beyond...
2120012868/Use my gift wisely.
2120012869/Alina's soul no longer understands who she is. Her memory has joined all the women who died in the sun-drenched fields.
2120012870/I am no mistress of Fate. I have seen your past and your future, yet I can speak of neither.
2120012871/Very well. Even if you never know yourself and forces propel you like wind carries a leaf, it is worth remaining a decent man.
2120012872/Good.
2120012873/In gratitude, I will part the curtain of mists, allowing you to recall something of your past abilities.
2120012874/I jest. It wasn't that bad. Now we are even.
2120012875/Yes?
2120012876/Welcome, Geralt.
2120012877/For you do not know it, but I know you - by reputation.
2120012878/The peace of my land has been disturbed. The humans and the vodyanoi quarrel due to greed, fear, and misunderstanding.
2120012879/Try again, witcher.
2120012880/Sometimes I see the future, witcher.
2120012881/Who is in the right?
2120012882/Thank you again, witcher. Return to the village. Your destiny has yet to be fulfilled...
2120012883/I honor your wish to forge your fate. Know that you bear both my blessing and my favor.
2120012884/But you sided with humans against another race...
2120012885/...Distant and cold? Weak, witcher.
2120012886/Haha! None has ever paid me such a compliment. My brave knights only praised my soul, though I knew where their eyes fixated...
2120012887/Regardless... Geralt, must I tell you my desire or can you divine it?
2120012888/Enough, Sir Bonehead. I understand more than you think.
2120012889/Another chalice for my collection then. I shall not stand in destiny's way. I bid you farewell, none too fondly.
2120012890/How goes your search, Sir Bonehead?
2120012891/Enough. I choose not to believe you don't find me attractive. Rather, I blame your famous scruples.
2120012892/Clearly my vision pertained to you, Geralt.
2120012893/Lost souls of the dead are more sensitive than the living. Poetry should halt her long enough to see her damned sister.
2120012894/Indeed. Here, pour a drop of my blood onto the altar. Challenge Dagon to a duel.
2120012895/In answering my question, you have answered your own.
2120012896/They claimed it their destiny to find the Holy Grail. Alas, my powers cannot vanquish destiny. I failed at guiding the poor wretches onto the right path.
2120012897/If you return intent on a mission of paramount importance... Believe me, I can be unpleasant.
2120012898/Tell me.
2120012899/I shall not keep you.
2120012900/Cease treating me like a goddess. I have enough worshippers. I lack one who sees me as other than the object of a cult...
2120012901/I judge them not. But let's return to your desire to help. Begin by paying me a compliment...
2120012902/You slew the bloody divinity Dagon...
2120012903/Then you must slay Dagon. To do so, bring me objects symbolizing harmony from both communities.
2120012904/But you sided with the vodyanoi against another race...
2120012905/And brought the races together in peace. I am content.
2120012906/Indeed. Go to the altar and challenge him.
2120012907/I trust that in uttering those words you understand their weight. Rejecting Destiny renders you responsible for all your choices, good and bad.
2120012908/I have confidence in my source... the mermaid Sheenazz.
2120012909/Yes. Why are you surprised?
2120012910/That you prevented conflict between the Prince of Agloval and the inhabitants of the underwater city of Ys.
2120012911/I know you didn't return by chance. First you must answer: do you believe in Destiny?
2120012912/Good luck, witcher.
2120012913/You assume correctly. You may speak to the vodyanoi priest near my statue. Julian represents the humans.
2120012914/The dead only hear the dead. Do you know any prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for her?
2120012915/Hmm, Sheenazz called you clever... yet your voice betrays that tone so typical of males, who think they may treat their lovers as property.
2120012916/Males are all alike.
2120012917/Speak with the hermit watching over the graves of those brave seekers. Though boring, he knows the Grail's legend perfectly.
2120012918/Just so. Know you the legend of the Grail?
2120012919/Stop! I'm a lady!
2120012920/The king will punish you!
2120012921/He's so courtly...
2120012922/That minstrel was divine...
2120012923/I should be at court now.
2120012924/I appreciate the thought.
2120012925/Oh my, it's raining.
2120012926/My hair is ruined!
2120012927/This rain is giving me a headache.
2120012928/Depressing weather.
2120012929/The neighborhood has lost charm since they let the rabble in.
2120012930/I refuse to look at that nastiness.
2120012931/Know your place, witcher.
2120012932/The king will punish you!
2120012933/Uninteresting...
2120012934/What nonsense...
2120012935/That minstrel was alluring...
2120012936/I beg you! Help!
2120012937/I feel so embarrassed.
2120012938/Quite the storm.
2120012939/My hair is ruined!
2120012940/Rain gives me a headache.
2120012941/This weather is depressing.
2120012942/The sorceress Philippa Eilhart is in town.
2120012943/My husband insists the Nilfgaardian Empire finances the Scoia'tael.
2120012944/Be off!
2120012945/I heard Yaevinn is a demon in elven form.
2120012946/I'll call the guards!
2120012947/I shan't speak with a vagabond.
2120012948/My brother gifted all he owned to the Order to become a knight. I'm so proud!
2120012949/Why did they declare martial law in this district alone?
2120012950/Velerad has gone gray just recently.
2120012951/Begone!
2120012952/I hope Jacques de Aldersberg throws a wonderful ball.
2120012953/Why do you stare, vagabond? Never seen a noble woman?
2120012954/I hate it here.
2120012955/I dislike you.
2120012956/All these plebs should be working!
2120012957/I seldom leave the royal palace. Even in a seemingly good neighborhood, I meet individuals like you.
2120012958/I'm a baroness. I don't consort with your kind.
2120012959/Word says Roderick de Wett is Princess Adda's lover.
2120012960/Supposedly, Velerad cares little for Princes Adda.
2120012961/Shove off!
2120012962/You're a handsome man, but I already have a partner.
2120012963/Do you witchers only like sorceresses?
2120012964/You saved us from certain death. Thank you. The elves left us to the monsters' mercy...
2120012965/We heard terrible screams down those corridors. The monsters must have...
2120012966/Thanks be to Melitele and may you be blessed.
2120012967/Thank you.
2120012968/If you seek Haren Brogg, visit the river house.
2120012969/Visiting the witch? She's in the village.
2120012970/Ask the reverend to pray for you.
2120012971/Why did they all come if they dislike Leuvaarden?
2120012972/I have had enough of business and politics.
2120012973/I've no interest in politics.
2120012974/My family's treasures are in that bank...
2120012975/It's those Scoia'tael again.
2120012976/Why attack the Town Hall?
2120012977/We shouldn't negotiate with terrorists.
2120012978/My husband was supposed to go to the Town Hall!
2120012979/They're shooting from the windows again.
2120012980/Mmm... Strange fellows like you excite me.
2120012981/You do not look a knight, sir.
2120012982/The famous Geralt of Rivia!
2120012983/Have you seen that slut Merigold's attire? How indecent!
2120012984/I hope Foltest runs that sorceress out of town.
2120012985/Velerad spoke well of you. A pleasure to meet you.
2120012986/I beg you! Help!
2120012987/Extraordinary...
2120012988/Simpletons all around.
2120012989/I'm dying of boredom.
2120012990/Help! Please!
2120012991/That's pure impertinence!
2120012992/It's raining!
2120012993/A new frock, all wet!
2120012994/Not rain!
2120012995/Nasty weather.
2120012996/You whisk children away, turn them into witchers! You should be ashamed!
2120012997/There's a trophy like that in my uncle's dining hall.
2120012998/Knights should fight monsters. Witchers are crude.
2120012999/I have connections!
2120013000/Doubtless Adda's idea...
2120013001/Ruffian.
2120013002/Have I fallen into disfavor?
2120013003/Help!
2120013004/Oh my, what was that supposed to mean?
2120013005/It's raining, unfortunately.
2120013006/Dreadful weather.
2120013007/Must it rain right now?
2120013008/I refuse to be soaked like a duck.
2120013009/Shh... Beautiful music...
2120013010/Master Dandelion is truly talented.
2120013011/They say Dandelion has other strengths, hehe...
2120013012/I heard they exact gold and abduct children.
2120013013/The reverend himself said so!
2120013014/Who did it claim?
2120013015/Impossible!
2120013016/Gods must've punished him.
2120013017/I bought a frock. Just had to wash out some blood...
2120013018/The guards will soon come for him.
2120013019/Vagabonds aren't allowed in the Trade Quarter.
2120013020/I await my beloved. When will they open the gate?
2120013021/Be off!
2120013022/Soldiers are simpletons! Only knights should guard this quarter.
2120013023/The Grand Master and King Foltest dislike each other, so they say.
2120013024/I must aquire an invitation to Leuvaarden's next banquet.
2120013025/Be off!
2120013026/Adda has porridge for brains. With her father away, she endlessly entertains herself.
2120013027/Do I look like a monster to you?
2120013028/Begone!
2120013029/I like the hubbub of the marketplace.
2120013030/You're a witcher?
2120013031/So physical and rough, unlike my husband. I enjoy men like that.
2120013032/My husband's away. Care to visit?
2120013033/Money?! I'm rich, money bores me, witcher!
2120013034/That's nasty! I was expecting a kikimore's claw...
2120013035/A witcher in bed cures my boredom.
2120013036/Yes. I know witchers are inhumanly effective, and for coin, they'll undertake any task.
2120013037/Don't deny it! Perhaps you don't fancy me?
2120013038/You're a mollusk like my husband. I scorn you.
2120013039/A kikimore jumped out of a tunnel right next to me.
2120013040/Prove yourself to me! I want a piece of some monster!
2120013041/Gemstones are dull... I was hoping for an interesting necklace...
2120013042/Yes, a real man, not some city dandy. Come see what a real woman can do!
2120013043/What?! No one's ever treated me like a cheap whore!
2120013044/When Foltest returns, he's sure to oust Velerad.
2120013045/Melitele bless you.
2120013046/Someone send you to see Odo? Someone that wealthy had to end badly.
2120013047/Save us from the Beast.
2120013048/The plague still lingers in abandoned houses.
2120013049/Of a sort. I wish to send them some coin to... alleviate their situation. Understand?
2120013050/Wish on a star! A witcher! In my native Beauclair in the Duchy of Toussaint, a witcher once spent an entire holiday feast dancing with a sorceress...
2120013051/Naturally, the nobility in Toussaint knows naught about politics and court intrigue. You can surmise the rest...
2120013052/Exactement. I only hope they return home safely.
2120013053/Ah! Parfait! My cousins -- Corbin, Buse, and Ramerot -- sought refuge in the swamp, in the caves there. Please deliver 300 orens each to them.
2120013054/Très bien! Mon dieu, my three cousins recently fled the city due to some... hmm... unfortunate coincidences.
2120013055/My cousins will each give you a receipt. Take these to Old Vizima, to the captain of the mercenaries, my fiancé. He will reward you.
2120013056/Hmmm, do all witchers have white hair?
2120013057/Simple. The Duchy of Toussaint remains neutral. My countrymen prefer feasts, balls, and producing the best wine in the world.
2120013058/It can become quite boring.
2120013059/I'm occupied.
2120013060/Perhaps I am confused. Regardless, I do have a certain matter for you...
2120013061/I'm listening, Sire.
2120013062/I beg you! Help!
2120013063/Extraordinary...
2120013064/Simpletons all around.
2120013065/I'm dying of boredom.
2120013066/Call this a gift?
2120013067/Help! Please!
2120013068/That was just impertinent!
2120013069/Rain!
2120013070/A new frock, all wet!
2120013071/Not rain!
2120013072/Nasty weather.
2120013073/You whisk children away, turn them into witchers! You should be ashamed!
2120013074/There's a trophy like that in my uncle's dining hall.
2120013075/Knights should fight monsters. Witchers are crude.
2120013076/Help me!
2120013077/Is that so?
2120013078/Interesting...
2120013079/Hmm... That seems satisfactory...
2120013080/What, you call this is a gift?
2120013081/Help! I beg you!
2120013082/How impertinent!
2120013083/It's raining.
2120013084/A new frock, soaked!
2120013085/Why must it rain?!
2120013086/Horrible weather.
2120013087/I don't talk to strangers.
2120013088/Siegfried fancies my daughter.
2120013089/I can't fathom how a horde of bandits and nonhumans held the city hostage.
2120013090/Monsters? You need only ask the royal knights to destroy them.
2120013091/I dislike you.
2120013092/Princess Adda talks of you. I envy her....
2120013093/Perhaps you found my silk scarf?
2120013094/If you command a sword as well as your tongue, you must be the greatest warrior.
2120013095/Those kikimores... Eternal Fire! I'm leaving!
2120013096/You intimidate me.
2120013097/Thank you, kind sir. How courtly.
2120013098/I confess the scarf was a mere ploy. Will you forgive me?
2120013099/You intimidate me, truly.
2120013100/Velerad should cleanse the ghetto.
2120013101/The Grand Master of the Order has bestowed a magnificent sum upon families of men slain by Scoia'tael.
2120013102/Shove off!
2120013103/I wish not to speak of serious matters. I'm here to relax.
2120013104/I feel I've heard of you. I don't recall the context, but I remember it was a bloody story.
2120013105/The men by the temple spoke of you!
2120013106/Lovely flowers... You deserve several tulips.
2120013107/Wait... The flaming lizard folk asked after you. They mentioned lying in wait for you...
2120013108/Oh! If you brought me but a small bouquet of wild flowers, I'd gladly give you tulips in exchange.
2120013109/People cared for flowers once... Now I alone cultivate tulips...
2120013110/Julian appears a decent youth.
2120013111/Wandering rogues scared my cat away.
2120013112/You could use an honest job, sonny.
2120013113/A gaspier appeared by the old tree again. Or perhaps a nightwraith?
2120013114/Away, you freak.
2120013115/Ready, Geralt?
2120013116/Quick, Geralt. They'll be here any minute.
2120013117/No, but I've never killed a man.
2120013118/Who'd be foolish enough to attack us?
2120013119/Quick! To the laboratory!
2120013120/These men are suicidal!
2120013121/At them!
2120013122/Come on, Geralt. Let's show that mage who's in charge!
2120013123/Geralt! Kill the bandits first!
2120013124/You can do it! He's not that fast!
2120013125/Let's go!
2120013126/I'm ready!
2120013127/Let's show these bandits.
2120013128/Hurry, Geralt!
2120013129/Hit that debris with the Aard Sign and let us through.
2120013130/Geralt, cast the Aard!
2120013131/Geralt, approach the stone at the center.
2120013132/This is a Circle of Power. Approach the central stone.
2120013133/Hurry, Geralt!
2120013134/Follow me!
2120013135/No time to talk. Intruders inside, follow me! I can't take them on alone...
2120013136/Run! They were headed toward the lab.
2120013137/Geralt! Run!
2120013138/These stairs lead to the lab.
2120013139/The Aard. I can't do it since I broke my fingers training along the Gauntlet...
2120013140/Cast the Aard at the debris.
2120013141/They're robbing us... Geralt, clear the passage upstairs! Use a Sign!
2120013142/Let's go to the Circle of Elements, a source of the Power. You need to try to learn the Aard.
2120013143/We're cut off! The stairs are blocked!
2120013144/Wow!
2120013145/Hurry.
2120013146/I knew it would work!
2120013147/Success?
2120013148/Hurry.
2120013149/They're robbing us! We have to do something.
2120013150/We need Triss' help. We have to get out of here.
2120013151/Quick!
2120013152/Did you hear Triss? They're destroying the lab. We can't let them steal our secrets!
2120013153/I wanted to help, but I couldn't break through that strange circle.
2120013154/Are you hurt? Did he get you?
2120013155/We need to help Triss.
2120013156/Come on, Geralt! We need to get to the lab.
2120013157/Geralt, please hurry. We need to see what's happening in the lab.
2120013158/Geralt, wait!
2120013159/Bandits inside. Drink the Thunderbolt potion Vesemir gave you.
2120013160/Cast the Aard at the rubble blocking the stairs!
2120013161/Quick, Geralt! We need to check the lab!
2120013162/We need to get to the lab!
2120013163/Quick! To the laboratory!
2120013164/Geralt, I'm waiting! Lead the way.
2120013165/Geralt, let's go inside.
2120013166/The bells in the Upper Courtyard!
2120013167/Me, too.
2120013168/Armed men coming from the forest!
2120013169/I can handle this.
2120013170/Should've picked a fight with someone else!
2120013171/You can't defeat a witcher!
2120013172/Wait!
2120013173/Taste this witcher's blade!
2120013174/Geralt! Great work!
2120013175/Pretty impressive.
2120013176/NOT_USED
2120013177/Ha! It worked!
2120013178/Shit... What is that?
2120013179/What's happening?
2120013180/There's more. They're entering the Upper Courtyard!
2120013181/They're ransacking the lab. We have to stop them!
2120013182/Geralt, there's the leader!
2120013183/I know. Every time Lambert beats me, he says I have potential.
2120013184/We were fencing on the floor pegs when that strange storm came. Lambert looked away, I did a pirouette, hit him right in the gut... He didn't fall and then he beat me.
2120013185/I've heard all of Dandelion's ballads about you. Lambert tells me I'll never be as fast as a real witcher... but I managed to hit him during training today.
2120013186/You mock destiny. You mock it and trifle with it. Destiny is a double-edged sword. You are one edge, and the other is death? No, it's we who die - because of you.
2120013187/Unable to catch you, death contents itself with us. Death stalks you, following in your footsteps, White Wolf. But others die. Because of you...
2120013188/I've wanted lobster soup for a while.
2120013189/No, but I hear the old man killed one some time back.
2120013190/Mantis, lobster, same difference. I'm making soup.
2120013191/You killed a few in your time...
2120013192/Let them come! We'll teach them the meaning of pain and fear!
2120013193/She's not all bad, though too smart for her own good sometimes. We'll talk when things calm down. Drink your Thunderbolt potion and explore the Keep...
2120013194/They've no idea what they're in for.
2120013195/Get it done quickly and you may be back in time for the frightener.
2120013196/Sorceresses are a separate matter...You have a weakness for them, and it's mutual. Merigold cried when she told us of your disappearance.
2120013197/Heheh. Sounds poetic but there's little or no philosophy involved. Devised by Temerian landsknechts, simple men, it's best against heavy, armored opponents.
2120013198/The Fiery Dancer is absolutely superb against barghests and ghouls...
2120013199/The art of combat involves three traditional swordfighting styles plus a few variations designed for combatting monsters.
2120013200/Any other questions?
2120013201/Witchers employ three fighting styles. There's Addan Aenye - the Fiery Dancer, which we call the fast style.The Viroledan Naev'de Feaine Glaeddyv - the group style. And the Temerian Devil, the strong style.
2120013202/You noticed we carry two swords. That's because some monsters are immune to steel, a normal sword won't cut them.
2120013203/Then Merigold appeared. Shaking, delirious - she insisted we chase the Wild Hunt. Vesemir agreed - he's always had a soft spot for her.
2120013204/The Devil's best against kikimores, graveirs, and fleders.
2120013205/She's too pretentious for my taste.
2120013206/All right...
2120013207/You'll be all right, Wolf. Your body will recall all it needs to, certain things you never forget...
2120013208/No problem, Wolf.
2120013209/Amateurs. If not for the mage and the frightener, we'd have beaten them blindfolded.
2120013210/And the Viroledan - anything that attacks in groups, but initially limit it to drowners.
2120013211/Trust your intuition when choosing your fighting style.
2120013212/Werewolves, vampires, genies, and other magical beasts. The techniques for fighting with a silver sword derive from traditional swordsmanship, but there are a few essential differences. No parries and ripostes, mainly steps, evasive moves, spins, and other acrobatics.
2120013213/The legendary elven swordsman and poet Nissail created it, basing the system of steps and cuts on his observations of wildcats, especially the ocelots that elven rulers used as palace guards.
2120013214/They say masters of this style can fight nine opponents simultaneously.
2120013215/We were sparring when that storm arrived. My medallion jerked so hard I almost fell. The boy saw an opening... Ah, he certainly had potential.
2120013216/Kaer Morhen is the wolf's school. Old Vesemir always made sure we trained more as warriors than mages, though we also learn the Signs.
2120013217/Literally translated, it is the Nine Sun Swords style. The swordsmen of Viroledo developed it as a method for tackling several opponents through complex slashing sequences.
2120013218/Which style do you want to hear about?
2120013219/What is it, Wolf?
2120013220/The Fiery Dancer favors speed and agility over strength of blows. Opponents simply don't have time to strike back. "The Ideal Swordsman is a flame that cannot be hurt and inflicts wounds each time it is touched." Nissail himself wrote that. The style is popular among the elven aristocracy.
2120013221/True. But we'll find them.
2120013222/Merigold, I'm interested in whether you can disarm Savolla. The rest is witchers' work.
2120013223/Don't panic, Merigold. We know you'd like to see our witchers' secrets...
2120013224/That we know, Merigold. You could try some of your famous magic...
2120013225/We're not masons...
2120013226/You're jumping to conclusions...
2120013227/The claw of a mighty beast and some celandine. Vesemir will tell you where to find them.
2120013228/Good. You'll need two more things to make the potion.
2120013229/Talk to Vesemir. He'll give you instructions.
2120013230/In the evening hall, inside a chest.
2120013231/If you find any stragglers, finish them. We don't need prisoners.
2120013232/You should find a vial of White Gull in the armory on the upper floor.
2120013233/Grab some Calcium Equum from the evening hall. Look for white stones in one of the chests.
2120013234/Geralt, is something wrong?
2120013235/He wasn't ready... What a loss. We'll hunt them down, Wolf. We'll avenge Leo.
2120013236/I'd go, but Merigold lies unconscious by the fire.
2120013237/The stairs are through that door.
2120013238/There're still some bandits left upstairs, Wolf. Tend to them.
2120013239/What is it?
2120013240/There should be White Gull in a crate in the armory on the upper floor.
2120013241/The room is full of weapons. You'll know it when you see it.
2120013242/What do you need?
2120013243/Let me teach you the formula.
2120013244/You'll pay for that!
2120013245/Die!
2120013246/Go on, Geralt!
2120013247/There's not time to lose.
2120013248/You're pathetic.
2120013249/Time to die.
2120013250/Vesemir, we've got company!
2120013251/Then I'll head east, to Kaedwen. Unless someone objects.
2120013252/The one dwarf-owned bank remaining will doubtless close soon.
2120013253/I should leave...
2120013254/I barely escaped some creatures last night.
2120013255/Help! Summon the soldiers!
2120013256/The shipment should be here...
2120013257/I'll wait until tomorrow.
2120013258/What has Foltest thought up now?
2120013259/I'll be damned if you walk away from my shop dissatisfied!
2120013260/Behold! The best goods in the civilized world!
2120013261/Guards! Someone call the guards!
2120013262/Forget it.
2120013263/It's really raining now.
2120013264/Great, it'll probably rain until morning.
2120013265/It's raining.
2120013266/It's raining hard.
2120013267/I'm exhausted.
2120013268/Help!
2120013269/That's what I'll do...
2120013270/Til tomorrow...
2120013271/Why that?
2120013272/Call the guards!
2120013273/It's really raining.
2120013274/It'll rain through tomorrow.
2120013275/It's raining.
2120013276/A real downpour.
2120013277/I'm more curious about your conclusions.
2120013278/Azar Javed has sent a special force north. My men saw them. He, too, knows something's brewing and is making preparations.
2120013279/Some larger scheme's at play in Redania. Few people know this secret. King Foltest, the Lodge of Sorceresses, and I watch the northern border.
2120013280/My secretary.
2120013281/I'm diversifying risk.
2120013282/Go ahead. I have a little patience left.
2120013283/You'll regret this!
2120013284/You again? They let you into town?
2120013285/Not now!
2120013286/Yes. I assume you're not asking for curiosity's sake?
2120013287/I may... The dock by the swamp is crucial to my business. The creatures have caused me losses.
2120013288/Drowners. They emerge at night, destroying goods and murdering carriers. I'll pay 400 orens to be rid of them.
2120013289/Indeed.
2120013290/I know nothing.
2120013291/Can I return to my business?
2120013292/Yes, occasionally. I pay my taxes, for instance.
2120013293/All right, speak.
2120013294/What? That's slander! You'll regret this! Guards!
2120013295/Wise choice. You should trust your instincts more.
2120013296/A modest merchant. Allow me to show gratitude with a gift...
2120013297/This symbol signifies my secret society. We seek to destroy Salamandra.
2120013298/The Salamanders have risked much. This is a political matter, let me tell you...
2120013299/You're mistaken!
2120013300/If so, bring me three pins. Then we'll talk.
2120013301/Excellent. I normally pay 20 apiece, but I'll make an exception. I'll give you ten times that.
2120013302/They're not good for business.
2120013303/I once purchased one for its magical potential, which turned out false. And I paid a mage a costly sum for the examination!
2120013304/Sell my Tipperath? I'm rather fond of it...
2120013305/Then speak with Kalkstein. He's no mage but has considerable theoretical knowledge.
2120013306/You think me a seller of turnips? I run businesses you can't even fathom.
2120013307/You're confusing reflected stars for the night sky. I'm waiting for important news.
2120013308/I am.
2120013309/Yes?
2120013310/Sad to end up in some forgotten village...
2120013311/Well, I thank you, wholeheartedly.
2120013312/Ah, right. Your 200 orens...
2120013313/I won't interfere with your methods, but remember, my time is valuable.
2120013314/I knew you'd do it! Here's your payment.
2120013315/Tax collectors are bandits. Now, I must return to work. Farewell!
2120013316/Hardly unusual in any business. The guards get their... bonuses.
2120013317/I'm doing them a favor. They don't have to toil over my customs declarations.
2120013318/Now excuse me - I need to earn some coin.
2120013319/Witcher, you're mistaking reflected stars for the night sky.
2120013320/Never mind. It has nothing to do with Salamandra.
2120013321/Farewell.
2120013322/Why would I bother with a criminal?
2120013323/Would I do it so clumsily as to implicate myself?
2120013324/All businesses. Listen, there are forces beyond your imagination at work here. Be thankful you don't know the world for what it is.
2120013325/That I'd like to see. Should you succeed, find me and I'll reward you handsomely.
2120013326/And if you destroy Salamandra as a whole, I will repay you for your efforts.
2120013327/I'll help if I can.
2120013328/500 orens?
2120013329/I wear Tipperath as an amulet. We can deal right now.
2120013330/No hurry. I'm not that eager to make the trade.
2120013331/I sadly relinquish it, but my reputation would suffer, as would my business, if I did not deal. The Sephirah is yours.
2120013332/Impressive. You have proof?
2120013333/I can't help. If you've time... an emissary of the Lodge of Sorceresses will be in town shortly.
2120013334/Nice analysis. Let's discuss this no further.
2120013335/How did you arrive at that conclusion?
2120013336/A broad network of associates.
2120013337/I told him to.
2120013338/You say contraband, I say importation.
2120013339/You can't make a living cultivating violets.
2120013340/Oh?
2120013341/I don't deal with them.
2120013342/I'm saving for a boat fare to get me away from here.
2120013343/No doubt I'll be devoured by a beast before they cure the plague!
2120013344/Begone, freak!
2120013345/See you again, perhaps.
2120013346/My friend tried evading the quarantine to enter Vizima.
2120013347/Be careful. My friend has dealt with monsters before. If he's dead, surely danger follows.
2120013348/Will you take the job?
2120013349/Finally, someone sensible here...
2120013350/We heard goods were smuggled into Vizima that way.
2120013351/What killed him?
2120013352/I don't know what that is. But I trust you'll fulfill the deal and bury the body?
2120013353/Leuvaarden, merchant. Of THOSE Leuvaardens.
2120013354/I don't know. I'll pay you 200 orens to rescue him or provide for a decent burial.
2120013355/Then I can leave with a clear conscience.
2120013356/Any news?
2120013357/We agreed. A decent burial. Or I won't pay.
2120013358/Lacking anything better, the crypt beneath the Reverend's church.
2120013359/Unfortunately. My friend disappeared in the cave beneath Vizima's walls.
2120013360/Ah... your 200 orens.
2120013361/Sad to end in some forgotten village...
2120013362/The location of the last Salamander cell in Vizima's Merchant Quarter.
2120013363/Not so simple. It's beyond the Supervised Zone. Entrance is forbidden.
2120013364/He'll respond to a password.
2120013365/A city guard officer is our informer. He's posted in Vizima's streets.
2120013366/Can't help you. Look around the swamp.
2120013367/Press him harder, he's sure to talk...
2120013368/Know anyone who buys fisstech? The guard Jethro?
2120013369/Why the sarcasm?
2120013370/I was there once, met someone named Vaska...
2120013371/The most reasonable of the bunch. Try her.
2120013372/Salamandra have ruffled some feathers. The Scoia'tael, the Order of the Flaming Rose...
2120013373/We have news about Salamandra!
2120013374/Salamandra has strong political backing. We've been unable to convince town or military authorities to take them on.
2120013375/We need support - an army unit or similar force...
2120013376/I suspect it relates to recent suspicious edicts.
2120013377/We'd like you to negotiate with our potential allies.
2120013378/If you succeed, we will meet them here.
2120013379/No. Only one lasting solution to this problem remains.
2120013380/We need time. Return later.
2120013381/I'm glad you've come.
2120013382/The old saying goes: any enemy of my enemy is my friend.
2120013383/Exactly. Will you help destroy Salamandra?
2120013384/Yes?
2120013385/Wonderful. Inform Triss at her house.
2120013386/Show it to Triss. She knows about such things.
2120013387/I know nothing about magic.
2120013388/Wonderful. It's as we've heard.
2120013389/All secret societies need gold. Fisstech yields the largest profits for Salamandra.
2120013390/Our spies say there's a new Salamander camp in the swamps. The herbs are harvested, then conducted to another base in Vizima's Temple Quarter.
2120013391/We're confident you can destroy both camps. If you discover papers, evidence that might aid us, return to me.
2120013392/Both camps are new, without sure defenses - a simple matter for you. The Salamanders would slaughter groups of humans easily...
2120013393/We need solid information, Geralt.
2120013394/Bring me papers from both camps.
2120013395/Great! I'll deliver them to our code breakers. Return tomorrow. We'll assay our next move.
2120013396/Speak the words "The lily has yet to be engulfed by flames."
2120013397/He will answer, "Three lilies make one." He will direct you to the hideout.
2120013398/Of course.
2120013399/Ha! Helping the sloths in this city would bankrupt me in a day.
2120013400/I'm a man of principle. If I helped the poor, I'd want to help all, without exception.
2120013401/Alas, no. Its influence reaches further than we anticipated...
2120013402/The Salamanders have a share in the fisstech trade.
2120013403/See me tomorrow if you need help. Triss obtained this formula especially for you.
2120013404/Nothing for you.
2120013405/Welcome. Noble beverages... and other goods.
2120013406/Forbidden by royal edict.
2120013407/I think the Flaming Rose should keep order in town.
2120013408/Velerad need only employ three sorcerers. Then, all the monsters and bandits would disappear.
2120013409/The storing law, taxes and the state of emergency are killing commerce in Vizima.
2120013410/Now with business done, I'll drink at the New Narakort.
2120013411/Have you heard the price of fur?!
2120013412/What do I do with 300 bolts of cloth?
2120013413/200 cords of lumber, and all of it green as a schoolboy!
2120013414/Craftsmen's output is falling due to martial law.
2120013415/Collecting a debt? They'll find their promissory notes in the manure!
2120013416/I spit on the damned speculators and usurers!
2120013417/I said 200! Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.
2120013418/I'm insulted.
2120013419/Witcher, slash these prices!
2120013420/I'm no seller. I'm meeting my business partners here.
2120013421/Need some salt? I stockpiled a dozen cartloads.
2120013422/Once I tried to fight the Merchants' Guild, but instead joined that esteemed organization.
2120013423/Leuvaarden and Roderick de Wett both hail from Nilfgaard. Draw your own conclusions.
2120013424/I signed a contract with the Order for a large batch of greaves. A profitable day.
2120013425/That damned Merchants' Guild not only trades with the Order, but also secretly sells arms to nonhumans.
2120013426/I don't deal in retail.
2120013427/I'm offended.
2120013428/My friend Julian wishes to enter the antiques business. I wonder where he finds such goods.
2120013429/Geralt of Rivia and Triss Merigold, welcome.
2120013430/I thank you for coming. Look about the room and you will see the entire kingdom represented.
2120013431/Forgive me, I must return to my duties. I'm certain we'll speak later.
2120013432/I'm busy now.
2120013433/This could spell trouble.
2120013434/You weren't followed...?
2120013435/Where's Geralt?
2120013436/Triss will teleport you and Yaevinn to the Salamandra base, where you'll open the gate.
2120013437/I once saw a mage who emerged from a teleport without his legs. They arrived 5 seconds later...
2120013438/Yaevinn has decided to cooperate.
2120013439/Triss will teleport you and Siegfried to the Salamandra base. You'll open the gate for the knights.
2120013440/I knew this knight who turned to soup while being teleported...
2120013441/The Order is apparently willing to cooperate.
2120013442/I wanna see!
2120013443/The Knights should slay those nonhumans.
2120013444/No safer deposit, they said! Pox on them!
2120013445/They should smoke 'em out!
2120013446/Kill the nonhumans!
2120013447/Freedom fighters?! They're terrorists!
2120013448/I heard they're planning to negotiate.
2120013449/My brother's inside.
2120013450/I fancy that blue-eyed one.
2120013451/This should be banned... for plebs.
2120013452/Hard work deserves a reward...
2120013453/I've never drank ale superior to that of Murky Waters.
2120013454/Disturbing events preceded my departure from Vizima. I must hurry back.
2120013455/Ruuuuun!
2120013456/Defend yourself, bum!
2120013457/Please, no!
2120013458/Come on.
2120013459/Follow me, boys!
2120013460/Follow me, dammit!
2120013461/See? He's dead but doesn't know it yet.
2120013462/Fight, you oaf!
2120013463/Attack!
2120013464/Stick it up your arse.
2120013465/Not a step closer.
2120013466/I'll hang you by your own guts, human.
2120013467/NOT_USED
2120013468/NOT_USED
2120013469/NOT_USED
2120013470/Your reward, witcher.
2120013471/Instead of rescuing us you went sightseeing. Go ruin someone else's life.
2120013472/About time.
2120013473/We're independent, though we secure orders from merchants like Leuvaarden. We get weeks of work and a decent return.
2120013474/Real pleasure doing business, witcher.
2120013475/We'll see...
2120013476/Perhaps... for someone willing to take a risk.
2120013477/Listen. Monsters have made the route to Vizima difficult. And those fishpeople are bothering me.
2120013478/You don't know what beggartick looks like nor where to sell it.
2120013479/Despite the danger, the beasts leave us alone.
2120013480/Shove off!
2120013481/Yaren. I speak for the lumberjacks.
2120013482/Yes. We're low on supplies. Trouble isn't the word for it if you don't get rid of them quickly. I'll pay generously.
2120013483/Ask those living in the swamp if you can't find any.
2120013484/Negotiate?! Are you daft?
2120013485/Speak.
2120013486/The beggartick plant should be blooming in the swamp.
2120013487/To hell with you, bastard!
2120013488/Who are you?!
2120013489/The drug it makes is. Collect some blossoms and we could both earn a little.
2120013490/Near the brickmakers' village, but only at night.
2120013491/What am I supposed to do? Croak like a frog?
2120013492/You're testing me... but we'll take the chance.
2120013493/Nothing but a bunch of deviants. The brickmakers babble about their Lords and the underwater world, and the druids don't like the trees being felled.
2120013494/Great! Beggartick blossoms look like red orchids. Clumps grow throughout the swamp. Sell them to the ferryman.
2120013495/Hell! Get moving before we all die!
2120013496/Mainly drowners, bloedzuigers, and echinopsae.
2120013497/Begone, witcher. I won't talk now.
2120013498/I knew I could count on you. And the fishpeople?
2120013499/You blind? Everyone's left or dead.
2120013500/Some witcher. He accepted a job, then disappeared.
2120013501/No, we scare off woodpeckers. Of course we're responsible. We're lumberjacks!
2120013502/No... but someone asked about him days later. We weren't the only ones he escaped.
2120013503/The remains of a primeval forest. Rare species - they make excellent wainscoting.
2120013504/It pains me, but I need you again.
2120013505/Kiss my arse!
2120013506/Yes. Without me, these lazy louts wouldn't know when to piss. Him with the moustache... No matter what I do, he still pisses in his boots.
2120013507/With danger around, you need discipline. I rule with an iron fist so they can return home safely. Most will.
2120013508/These men need the gold, so they take the risk. You can't have pork if you don't kill the piglet.
2120013509/Problems? They look like red orchids growing in the swamp. The ferryman trades in them.
2120013510/Hrrr... hrrr...
2120013511/I'll kill you if I see you again.
2120013512/Are you deaf? Get plowed!
2120013513/NOT_USED
2120013514/NOT_USED
2120013515/This farce ends now.
2120013516/Stop! What use can my corpse be?
2120013517/Extraordinary!
2120013518/Curses, why must I see your fucking face?
2120013519/You present no challenge.
2120013520/Grab him!
2120013521/You irritate me.
2120013522/How ironic, our paths cross again! So near and yet so far. Fear not, witcher, we'll meet again, I assure you...
2120013523/You fail to grasp the basic rules governing this world. You're a genetically modified murderer with no place in modern society. But we'll tend to that problem next time. Farewell.
2120013524/You've triumphed. Go ahead, your invaluable witchers' treasure awaits.
2120013525/Never hurts to ask...
2120013526/You have what you wanted. Show mercy.
2120013527/So you can parry arrows in flight...
2120013528/NOT_USED
2120013529/Your time nears it's end, witchers. Enjoy things while you can.
2120013530/Let's see...
2120013531/I hear witchers can parry bolts in flight.
2120013532/Ah. Another fairy tale.
2120013533/The energy you annexed from the Circle of Elements is enough to stop the witchers?
2120013534/The aforementioned, considered dead, I might add, is a known killer. I'll gladly challenge him...
2120013535/The witcher is taking his time.
2120013536/I'll leave the matter to our best agent.
2120013537/Seems true. I assume the trap is set?
2120013538/I come at your command, master. I listen and obey, as a genie would.
2120013539/You see, witcher? Too much water around for Azar to feel comfortable. Fire mages... limited. He needs me to do the wet work.
2120013540/Azar, you fool! Let the witcher get the better of you! You nearly got me killed!
2120013541/We shall meet again, freak.
2120013542/Admirable fight, but duty calls us to the Trade Quarter. Contrary to popular opinion, chaos and terror do not spread on their own.
2120013543/Mistakes, witcher - they can be deadly. Give my greetings to that young companion of yours. And now, have a nice time dying.
2120013544/You've no chance!
2120013545/You can't defeat my entire army!
2120013546/I thought witchers were neutral...
2120013547/you've taken on the royal family.
2120013548/I'm impressed.
2120013549/You're not only mixed up in racial conflict,
2120013550/You're going to die!
2120013551/You'll never catch me!
2120013552/You're a screw-up!
2120013553/They failed to strip you of emotion. You were meant to slay monsters - without making judgments, philosophizing, or nursing doubts. You're ineffective.
2120013554/You owe your existence to the conjunction of spheres. But your creators erred. Know how?
2120013555/Why do you seek to prevent the creation of new witchers? The answer's simple: you feel you have no rightful place in this world.
2120013556/No doubt your life will end soon and how useless it's been! You'll die knowing you were an aberration...
2120013557/The sorceress and Illuminati will be arrested.
2120013558/...we all know the situation...
2120013559/...White Wolf proved a bigger problem than anticipated.
2120013560/I was forced to evacuate...
2120013561/...a few days and we'll be gone...
2120013562/I don't believe you... He give you anythin'?
2120013563/Uhh...
2120013564/I'd never...
2120013565/The Reverend can tell you I burned my box and renounced the devil... Talk to the dwarf, Zoltan.
2120013566/Don't know what folks have said, but I quit playing long ago. I swear!
2120013567/Well, there's wolves... lots of them... there's the dead' uns and there's elves 'n kobolds.
2120013568/Well... that cartiona or whatnot, damn plague's been about, killing folk. We got monsters, too.
2120013569/He knows a lot, wouldn't hurt to ask.
2120013570/The Order of the Burning Rose has got passes. The Eternal Fire fights the plague.
2120013571/They have passes, they do. The only ones. Leave me be. You have the evil eye, you bring bad tidings. Begone.
2120013572/NO! NO! NO! It was that vile witch, the devil's whore poisoned my Ilsa! NOOOOOOO!
2120013573/Halt... What?!
2120013574/Ilsa, my love... sniff...
2120013575/Sure, sir, uhh, I'll tell him what I know, which'll be little... and I don't have much gold, neither, but no matter, just so long as the dead'uns are slayed.
2120013576/Please, sir...
2120013577/Yah, commander told me to clear the crypt down the road... I've never fought beasts before... Too scared...
2120013578/Uuuh... I been told to get rid of those dead'uns...
2120013579/Dunno...
2120013580/Commander's job to know, not mine.
2120013581/There's a... what they call that... a quarternine.
2120013582/Heh heh... from the Reverend. Right.
2120013583/Phew... you had me there, witcher. Come by for a game sometime. Dull it is just standing here all day.
2120013584/Near the inn. There's a hill - an entrance in the...
2120013585/Ooh, heaps of them, sir, and them mutts have gone wild. Used to be I could pelt 'em with rocks, now I'm just afriad.
2120013586/I wanted to say... I... was... sorry. I apologize, witcher.
2120013587/And you're prodding your nose where you shouldn't.
2120013588/My job's to stand here as ordered, so here I stand.
2120013589/How's that my business?
2120013590/Does the Reverend know you're here?
2120013591/People with passes - they're allowed in.
2120013592/The Reverend said... worship the Fire sign. Seems he did send you.
2120013593/Strangers aren't welcome here. Be off.
2120013594/A hundred thanks, master. Here be a month's pay. Ha, the boys'll be happy. They planned to search for treasure in the crypt, take a pick to one o' the walls.
2120013595/Young woman? No! It can't be! My Ilsa...? I... I... I loved her...
2120013596/Yes, he asked who's allowed into the city, then came with that, uh, that letter of safe conduct... from the Order.
2120013597/Sergeant! That witcher's here, the one I told you about!
2120013598/Yes, sir, sergeant, sir. It's that filthy freak, the witcher.
2120013599/Shouldn't have defended the old man. He'll come talking again...
2120013600/The old man comes here and talks and talks. Gives me a headache. I'll stone him next time...
2120013601/Uhhh... Captain said, "Only admit those with passes."
2120013602/They're moving me to Mill Gate tomorrow. That's where I'll stand. If you have a pass, look for me there.
2120013603/... he wanted three crowns! In orens, that'll be...
2120013604/Plain robbery! They should arrest those officers!
2120013605/None may enter Vizima...
2120013606/Help! Murderer!
2120013607/I need an apprentice...
2120013608/Argh, terrible times.
2120013609/Nasty day.
2120013610/Things were better before the war with Nilfgaard.
2120013611/Why is your hair white?
2120013612/Murderer!
2120013613/Being funny?
2120013614/It's raining.
2120013615/Terrible weather.
2120013616/Damned rain.
2120013617/Not good, it's raining.
2120013618/I'd pay for that but I already have one.
2120013619/Don't mind the insults. Witchers are good men.
2120013620/Seems the castle's haunted again.
2120013621/Help!
2120013622/I love weddings.
2120013623/Noonwraiths? Nonsense...
2120013624/Come from afar, see no signs of a wedding.
2120013625/Somebody help!
2120013626/You'll gain nothing that way.
2120013627/It's raining.
2120013628/I'm getting all wet.
2120013629/What a downpour.
2120013630/We're in for a deluge.
2120013631/Help! Murderer!
2120013632/Heh heh, clever...
2120013633/I need an apprentice...
2120013634/Nasty day.
2120013635/Things were better before the war with Nilfgaard.
2120013636/Indecently low prices! Behold, stranger, laugh at my trader's naiveté!
2120013637/Gone wild! Lost it! Could these prices be any lower?
2120013638/Murderer!
2120013639/Nonsense.
2120013640/Always an uphill battle.
2120013641/Vile weather.
2120013642/Argh, drat, it's raining.
2120013643/Not good, it's raining.
2120013644/Get that corpse away from my stand, good man.
2120013645/Help! Murderer!
2120013646/Help me!
2120013647/I need an apprentice...
2120013648/Argh, terrible times.
2120013649/Everything was better before the war with Nilfgaard.
2120013650/No time for your jests.
2120013651/Always an uphill battle.
2120013652/It's raining.
2120013653/Dreadful weather.
2120013654/Damn, it's raining.
2120013655/Help! Murderer!
2120013656/Someone help me!
2120013657/What?
2120013658/Argh, terrible times.
2120013659/Everything was better before the Nilfgaard war.
2120013660/A stupid idea.
2120013661/Always an uphill battle.
2120013662/Dreadful weather.
2120013663/Damned rain.
2120013664/Rain's no good.
2120013665/Enough!
2120013666/You jest. They charge next to nothing.
2120013667/You won't find it cheaper elsewhere!
2120013668/Stupid and deaf.
2120013669/Her Ladyship was just leaving.
2120013670/Nonsense.
2120013671/Goodbye then.
2120013672/I don't set prices for my own amusement.
2120013673/Yet they do.
2120013674/With no gold for a bribe, best not bother with city hall.
2120013675/Scandal! The kingdom's capital and all efforts come to naught at city hall.
2120013676/My taxes endow fools in city hall.
2120013677/My patience for royal officials has ended.
2120013678/Rarely does anyone recall that the Order of the Flaming Rose was once the Order of the White Rose. Now, the once proud knights are racists and intriguers acting under the guise of the highest ideals. 'Tis the Grand Master's doing.
2120013679/They say you chase anything in a skirt, but you're a real dog for sorceresses. Supposedly you loved one once.
2120013680/Sure, the laundresses gossip about you.
2120013681/Women fear your fickleness, but you fascinate them. Eh, women.
2120013682/My wife is a laundress at the palace, so I'm aware of the gossip in court.
2120013683/A witcher dispelled the curse from the princess and Foltest was so overjoyed, he spoiled the girl rotten. The little striga became a childish whore.
2120013684/They say you're as likely to whip out your sword as you are to whip out your... Ahem. A master at both arts.
2120013685/They have the same opinion as any with common sense. A sorceress's place is in the tower, brewing potions and devising horoscopes from stars rather than meddling in politics. Furthermore, she's shameless to display her arse in such provocative attire.
2120013686/If Adda didn't already hold title as queen of the whores, Merigold would have it in a trice.
2120013687/I figured you a reasonable man, even if a mutant and a pawn.
2120013688/Moreover, he's a knight of the Order, so as someone sworn to celibacy he can only plow the princess in secret.
2120013689/Greetings, stranger. Be not afraid of Adda. She growls, but she doesn't bite ... usually.
2120013690/Our burgomaster drinks too much and can no longer manage the city's affairs. No wonder, since to curry favor in court, it is to be a marionette and jump when the king pipes a tune.
2120013691/You poor man! You've been indoctrinated by officials and by agitators who for a few pieces of silver whisper royalist propaganda in the ears of the masses! Open your eyes!
2120013692/Need I tell you all I know? He slept with his own sister and begat Adda. Ill tidings indeed. A curse turned the girl into a striga.
2120013693/Hmm?
2120013694/It would take weeks to repeat all she has said. Foltest, Velerad, de Wett, Jacques de Aldersberg, Merigold... Who are you interested in?
2120013695/Before his knighthood, Jacques was a vagrant blinded by hatred of elves. One doesn't change so easily.
2120013696/Certainly! I have the finest quality meat. I slaughter the animals myself.
2120013697/Look around: Bandits, monsters, and... City hall is silent.
2120013698/Velerad should step down.
2120013699/Plague upon Foltest! I spit on the monarchy, which long has been corrupt!
2120013700/The people should rule. Common people like you and me!
2120013701/At worst, they'll throw me in the dungeon. I believe we must speak true even of the ruling class. This is our right.
2120013702/Certainly, the women at the palace laundry love to gossip about other women.
2120013703/Indeed! I have no intention to fear a dictatorship based on the exploitation of common men! I will not cower under the grim repression of oligarchs and aristocrats who have enthroned a wrongdoer, a man whose hands are stained with blood!
2120013704/She is a bitch. Plus, she's pampered and spoiled. The name of the king's daughter suits her perfectly.
2120013705/Ah, the Nilfgaardian. He sticks to Adda like a burr on a dog's tail, but that threshold's high, even for a count.
2120013706/Grand Master sounds grandiose, doesn't it?
2120013707/De Wett represents the Order in court, but I'd say he represents the Empire of Nilfgaard and the imperial ambitions of the Black Ones.
2120013708/Welcome to my humble establishment!
2120013709/You're most welcome.
2120013710/A famous monster slayer gracing my modest inn.
2120013711/Not so long ago, an elf walked in here!
2120013712/Get out!
2120013713/I don't know. They spoke in a strange tongue, must've been elven. The dwarf handed the elf a truly sizeable pouch. If filled with gold, that elf became wealthy.
2120013714/You know them.
2120013715/They speak softly. I've heard very little.
2120013716/I've seen a witcher here lately...
2120013717/For a moment, the dwarf spoke another tongue, dictating something to the elf. He said:
2120013718/"Rebis, quebrith, hydragenum, hydragenum, vermilion." Perhaps a spell. Magic fire? I have no idea.
2120013719/What else... In dwarven, I only know the word for "fire," which they mentioned often. Maybe the Squirrels want to burn down town hall.
2120013720/I knew we'd agree. I've got nothing against gossiping about my customers now.
2120013721/Hmm... I overheard them talking about a password to an underground complex. Or was it a workshop.
2120013722/True, though not many since this state of emergency.
2120013723/Forgive me. Busy now.
2120013724/Yes, 5 orens.
2120013725/Yes, the wyvern meat. You have three pieces?
2120013726/One said the word, "Thorn."
2120013727/If so, you know all you need to know. If you feel you don't, honor my discretion.
2120013728/The noble Leuvaarden of the Merchants' Guild rented the first floor of my inn. I'm to supply food and drink and keep my mouth shut.
2120013729/Your coin.
2120013730/Quiet. I've said too much already.
2120013731/But most are in the ghetto. My strange guest was no town elf, but a member of the Scoia'tael.
2120013732/Soon after he appeared, so did some bandits. He refused to go with them. A fight ensued. That witcher turned those bandits into minced meat before I could blink.
2120013733/He killed them and disappeared. Bastard didn't even pay his check.
2120013734/These suspicious types have been coming here for a while. The soldiers ignore them.
2120013735/I didn't pry. I had no desire to know the vagrant.
2120013736/Get out of here before I call the soldiers.
2120013737/Can I help you?
2120013738/Lately I've had peculiar customers. They entertain themselves telling stories about monsters.
2120013739/Clearly, I don't know anything else.
2120013740/You are nosy, a terrible fault. I have a terrible fault, too. I'm greedy as hell.
2120013741/He forgot to grab his bundle on the way out, but there was nothing of value inside. Only books.
2120013742/No rush.
2120013743/I like gold, but you can't possibly pay me as much as Leuvaarden. Besides, I'd rather not annoy his backers.
2120013744/He had wild eyes, smelled of the swamp, and was scheming with a dwarf.
2120013745/You can have them. And you've paid his debt already.
2120013746/It's not every day I get an illustrious customer like you.
2120013747/I run into one, I'll have him impaled.
2120013748/Those damned elves are the worst of it. Make me want to puke.
2120013749/Heh.
2120013750/After that, the tournament was a mere formality.
2120013751/...We arrive on horseback in full armor, all polished and oiled. Morden hugged his steed with his knees and knelt. And then he pulled himself up! Horse and all...
2120013752/You know what Morden did at the tournament?
2120013753/The Zerrikan Market is the future of commerce.
2120013754/I knew a witcher. Peasants killed him.
2120013755/I hear prices will increase...
2120013756/Buy low, sell high. Rejoice in the profits and make the books look legal.
2120013757/I cannot believe I spoke to a princess!
2120013758/Leuvaarden has excellent taste.
2120013759/Quite a pleasing place.
2120013760/You wouldn't wonder at my being here if you knew my wife.
2120013761/Gold will fetch anything these days.
2120013762/An honest woman, that innkeeper.
2120013763/Somehow I cannot forget the maiden on the lakeside
2120013764/I'm Julian's kin. I'm pleased to meet the famous White Wolf.
2120013765/A special reward. This runic stone should be useful.
2120013766/The city should offer more rewards soon.
2120013767/I hear you slew 10 monters and brought proof. Impressive.
2120013768/This runic stone should be useful.
2120013769/Greetings, mister Geralt.
2120013770/I hear you killed three deadly beasts.
2120013771/Five monsters lie dead. Worthy of a reward.
2120013772/Enjoy.
2120013773/Greetings.
2120013774/The druids take in the innocent. I help them and provide protection.
2120013775/Ask, witcher.
2120013776/Deadly these are. You were lucky. 1000 orens reward.
2120013777/They say deadly monsters have made their lair near the crypt in the swamp.
2120013778/People speak of a bat-like creature and a female vampire. Could you look into it?
2120013779/Excellent, He'll murder no more humans. 1000 orens reward.
2120013780/I'd like to reward, but I'm short on funds. But...
2120013781/I can give you one of my two splendid swords, as you've truly aided Temeria.
2120013782/One is razor sharp steel, supposedly forged by dwarves. The other is elven silver. Both valuable, both deadly.
2120013783/Your reputation precedes you.
2120013784/All yours.
2120013785/A revolt rages in Vizima, people killing each other. I'm not interested.
2120013786/Not really. I'm cautious, though, and a few good deeds won't hurt.
2120013787/I do. Love your neighbor.
2120013788/You fight like a woman!
2120013789/I beg mercy!
2120013790/Retreat! That's an order!
2120013791/Halt!
2120013792/Riiiight.
2120013793/Everyone follow me! That's an order!
2120013794/There's your man. Attack!
2120013795/Come to me, worm!
2120013796/Attack! Grab 'em!
2120013797/Ha! You're losing strength!
2120013798/Nothing doing, witcher.
2120013799/A fair day's wage for a fair day's work...
2120013800/Calm down...
2120013801/No? So be it. What do you want?
2120013802/Greetings, witcher. I'm the local hunter...
2120013803/It's my professional secret.
2120013804/A monster supposedly haunts the lakeshore, devouring peasants late getting home.
2120013805/Perhaps a standard ghoul, but who knows? See for yourself.
2120013806/Wonder how I know you?
2120013807/Just that it hunts by the lake at night and kills people.
2120013808/It seems so...
2120013809/Since you're here...
2120013810/Impressive indeed for a drowner, even looks like... Holy Melitele! A drowned dead! That earns you 200 orens.
2120013811/What the...? Unlike any ghoul I've seen. Here, 200 orens.
2120013812/Depends, but on average... 80 orens.
2120013813/A ghoul may have made its lair in the crypt.
2120013814/Nothing, nothing...
2120013815/You witchers do nothing disinterestedly. Kill a monster, bring me proof, and I'll reward you generously.
2120013816/Greetings.
2120013817/I hear you killed three deadly beasts.
2120013818/A special reward. This runic stone should be useful.
2120013819/Not on my table, mister Geralt. Stinks of disease. Here's 600 orens.
2120013820/Your reputation precedes you.
2120013821/The city should offer more rewards soon.
2120013822/Five monsters lie dead. Worth a reward.
2120013823/A family heirloom, a book wherein all beasts are described and shown. Know what it says there?
2120013824/Locals, nothing but trouble. They probably tried to drive the wyverns off.
2120013825/Uhhhh....
2120013826/Mammoth. 400 orens, well-deserved.
2120013827/What the...? The nasty things on this earth. 400 orens.
2120013828/Ask.
2120013829/A huge wolf has appeared in the swamp, and the locals claim wyverns steal their children...
2120013830/Rewards for monsters... Got anything?
2120013831/Greetings.
2120013832/Each monster embodies a human iniquity, devourers - gluttony, vampires - drunkeness...
2120013833/This runic stone should be useful.
2120013834/Greetings, witcher.
2120013835/I was ordered back to Vizima. King Foltest is returning soon.
2120013836/In the meantime, I reward those who tend to public nuisances.
2120013837/600 orens is yours.
2120013838/One never knows when the Beast will appear.
2120013839/The Eternal Fire protects no sinners. Repent!
2120013840/We await help from the Order of the Flaming Rose.
2120013841/Vizima's gates are closed.
2120013842/Monsters abound in the crypt.
2120013843/The gate guards supposedly slew one of the bloodhounds.
2120013844/I hate beggars.
2120013845/If not for the village militia, we'd all be dead.
2120013846/I don't like the look of you.
2120013847/Wouldn't mind turning wenches' heads like you.
2120013848/What do you seek here?
2120013849/They pay me to stand guard, not to talk.
2120013850/I'm watching you.
2120013851/People like me illuminate the blackness of this age.
2120013852/I could use an escort some of the places I go.
2120013853/You shouldn't linger here.
2120013854/A medic recommended I take long walks, so I took this job.
2120013855/I enjoy this job.
2120013856/No mercy!
2120013857/I beg your mercy!
2120013858/Fall back!
2120013859/You should've surrendered!
2120013860/Move on or suffer.
2120013861/Army life's tough.
2120013862/At him!
2120013863/Be alert...!
2120013864/I'll lead you!
2120013865/Attack!
2120013866/Damn, I'm thirsty.
2120013867/For the king!
2120013868/Wrong, witcher.
2120013869/Help me!
2120013870/Traipsing around, lighting lanterns...
2120013871/Spare me! I merely light lanterns!
2120013872/Some stay awake so that others may sleep.
2120013873/Finishing up and hitting the sack.
2120013874/I thought I was the only one working.
2120013875/Back up or get hit with this torch!
2120013876/Damn, he'll extinguish everything.
2120013877/Plow this, I'd rather collect garbage.
2120013878/Done with.
2120013879/I hope they don't get wet.
2120013880/Well, you keep busy.
2120013881/NOT_USED
2120013882/NOT_USED
2120013883/What the hell... Shut the gate, quickly!
2120013884/The Beast! The Beast is attacking! Sound the alarm!
2120013885/NOT_USED
2120013886/NOT_USED
2120013887/Indeed.
2120013888/As a judge.
2120013889/Now that you mention it... You know, they said we'd have peace with the Black Ones defeated. Instead, we must suffer drowners, Scoia'tael and other filth.
2120013890/True...
2120013891/Ah, this is pretty peaceful for mercenary work.
2120013892/I stop at night, when the drowners come.
2120013893/Nothing, I told him to shove off. Still he comes back every evening.
2120013894/He who lingers at the ferryman's?
2120013895/And?
2120013896/Some guy offered me work in the swamp.
2120013897/That's the one.
2120013898/Beasts everywhere... Help!
2120013899/Merchants complain of drowners but we risk our necks.
2120013900/Shove off, freak!
2120013901/Everything reeks of fish!
2120013902/I joined the special forces during the war. I fear no Squirrel.
2120013903/A two-handed flamberg! Beautiful.
2120013904/What I'd give for some moonshine and two busty whores!
2120013905/Swords across his back - a garish array.
2120013906/Should have enlisted in the guards. We'd make twice the coin in bribes from Leuvaarden.
2120013907/Argh, the booze is done.
2120013908/These dogs are deadly!
2120013909/And that poor bastard by the bridge? Guts strewn about the ground.
2120013910/No door will stop the Beast.
2120013911/That bar across the gate won't do.
2120013912/Shh. We're safe.
2120013913/Folks lock themselves in at night and live to see the morning.
2120013914/No, we're safe here.
2120013915/They'll open when the plague ends. A week, a month.
2120013916/Plague and city mix poorly.
2120013917/Magic, witcher.
2120013918/Witcher...
2120013919/I am Jacques de Aldersberg, Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose.
2120013920/Witcher, are you all right?
2120013921/Our objective is a new world, a new order that will come after the White Frost. A world in which all will get what they merit, not by birth or through connections. A world where the strong help the weak and crime is duly punished. A world of clear principles and ideals!
2120013922/I shall remember those words.
2120013923/I have heard much about you and know of your deeds... from a very trustworthy source.
2120013924/The Order is an idea, from its foundations to its pinnacle: our mission, our vision.
2120013925/You owe me nothing.
2120013926/Siegfried, fall in. We need your strength and tactical wit.
2120013927/You've paid your debt.
2120013928/Though you're not human, every knight's duty is to aid those in need. An element of our vocation.
2120013929/Our rest is over! Fall in!
2120013930/You must know anyone can join, be they peasant, merchant, even witcher. Knights collect no payment and are promoted for great deeds...
2120013931/Pity about your lost memory, I could have reminded you of some things...
2120013932/I hope you'll understand when the Time comes.
2120013933/She has many names and is moody as a lover.
2120013934/Siegfried is no gossip. Even if he had told me, it would have been through a desire to help. No, my source was different.
2120013935/We both know that is immaterial. I regret what's happening, but the nonhumans took up arms. There is but one way to save the world from annihilation....
2120013936/You're mistaken. The Order's oath is clear and bright - every knight swears to enforce the law.
2120013937/Do you know anything about the Order?
2120013938/You cannot deny the nonhuman uprising is directed against the state. The Order was formed to uphold the law, maintain peace, and ensure our survival from the approaching White Frost.
2120013939/Until next time. We'll finish this conversation then!
2120013940/I hope when the Time comes, you'll understand.
2120013941/Ha, ha! Geralt of Rivia asking me for explanations. He who so generously lavishes his wisdom upon others.
2120013942/I don't intend to explain. Unlike you, I'm one to act. I want to laugh when I recall your pseudo-philosophical reflections.
2120013943/Witcher, only time can teach us. Only with perspective can one understand what is right - who is human, who a monster, what is evil and how to overcome it.
2120013944/Forgive me, I can get...irritable. Know they sometimes tell me of your deeds, and though I don't approve of them all, I'm always genuinely interested to hear them.
2120013945/I like to know what goes on in Temeria. It helps me appear in the right place at the right time.
2120013946/Witchers were meant to be guardians but proved too weak. You loathe yourselves.
2120013947/I needed holy knights as able as witchers, evoking an image of nobility, not a hand stretched out for coin.
2120013948/Do we lose heart, surrender? Never! We can yet avoid our fate.
2120013949/Understand, the Order and Salamandra acted only to save humanity.
2120013950/You witchers had it all, but lacked courage and vision. I merely did what you desired in your hearts.
2120013951/Are you incapable of seeing the golden path of my dreams? My knights will explain it to you in a way you will understand.
2120013952/Impossible. Only the Greater Brothers can do that, but they need to be taught and led. They need you!
2120013953/Only a grand plan pursued without hesitation could save humanity from what I saw in my visions!
2120013954/I needed witchers, but perfect ones - emotionless, lacking human weaknesses.
2120013955/How confident you seem. A painful lesson awaits.
2120013956/We won't disappear, not with the guardians I created. You'll see soon enough how well they manage in these conditions.
2120013957/I needed witchers but knew the secrets of mutation had been lost.
2120013958/The human nations can only survive the cold through a mass exodus south.
2120013959/Your guild's tenets proved a failure. Too much individualism.
2120013960/By pursuing me you proved me right! You faced the dangers that humanity faces and survived.
2120013961/I see you have met our degenerate great grandchildren... Do you understand now why you cannot oppose my plan?
2120013962/Many of the gifted foresaw the White Frost. Global cooling is this world's destiny.
2120013963/No, the good of all who would die. The dead wander here still. Tell them to their faces they did not deserve to live.
2120013964/The worst of all - my otherness. So I acted for the common good.
2120013965/How stubborn you are. I could use you to shepherd my sheep during the first years of winter.
2120013966/If you say so. When my troops arrive, ask what they think of me as their master.
2120013967/I never asked for these visions, this gift.
2120013968/You think this burden easy to bear?
2120013969/You lack humility. Time for a lesson in some.
2120013970/Patience. You may yet change your mind. Imagine thousands traversing an icy wasteland. Could you defend them? You and a handful of witchers ridden with doubt, like Berengar?
2120013971/Fear obscures your thinking. My knights never hesitate.
2120013972/Behold. The scales will fall from your eyes and you will understand!
2120013973/Hatred for hatred. I'll show you my creations. Honest, they don't hide their intentions behind beautiful faces.
2120013974/I'm prepared to do so. I see the future, I command respect, I would rule well. Of course, I had to get rid of any standing in the way. Especially nonhumans.
2120013975/You always believed man makes his own destiny. I seek to change all humanity's fate.
2120013976/You think this an illusion? Oh no, Geralt. It's nothing of the sort.
2120013977/Now that you have seen the ice-encased towers of Vizima, do you understand?
2120013978/This is the future. The White Frost has destroyed human civilization. This is the end of time.
2120013979/Geralt, they are condemned to perish. I gave them a chance to die in battle.
2120013980/You're joking. They detest humans.
2120013981/Like you, I tried to hide my otherness, to use my powers to redeem my sin.
2120013982/Geralt, I hear the wails of those who perished. Hear their cries and you will know my pain.
2120013983/Nonhumans, their extinction, is not a goal but a means. Since you detest humans so, I'll leave you with my no longer human serfs. You have much in common, you should get along.
2120013984/I chose the most just of causes - saving millions of lives.
2120013985/With the slaughter in Vizima, they discarded their noble masks. How can you stand with the murderers of women and children?
2120013986/Do you finally understand, obstinate witcher? Humanity will perish, the few who remain will become animals. My plan would avoid this.
2120013987/You have no notion of the approaching cataclysm. The spirits of those who perished wander here. Tell them they had no right to survive.
2120013988/Many times you insisted special gifts should be used for just causes.
2120013989/I was prepared to sacrifice anything, to save humanity at all costs. Do you know the saying, "The ends justify the means?"
2120013990/See for yourself. Follow me.
2120013991/Now do you see the need to act, whatever the price? Geralt, open your eyes, open your mind.
2120013992/You betrayed me!
2120013993/Wait!
2120013994/Die!
2120013995/Yes?
2120013996/What now?
2120013997/You can't stop me!
2120013998/Fool!
2120013999/No! Wait!
2120014000/Eternal Fire!
2120014001/Witcher.
2120014002/Yes, White Wolf?
2120014003/Flaming Rose!
2120014004/Sire, flames engulf half the city and the blood of your subjects fills the gutters. This is no time for word games, you must act.
2120014005/You return, Sire. I trust you are not too late... Your kingdom is in need.
2120014006/Allow me to command your army and the freedom to do as I see fit.
2120014007/It was close this time. Next time, I might arrive too late to help...
2120014008/NOT_USED
2120014009/Javed, can you hear me? What's going on?
2120014010/How are the experiments progressing? I urgently need those mutated knights of the Order in Vizima. And send me more failed ones. At this stage, I can afford no delays. Respond!
2120014011/Witcher Geralt...
2120014012/Useless De Wett. Have the town criers informed the people Adda has become a striga?
2120014013/Adalbert, I thank you for your loyal service.
2120014014/Take him away.
2120014015/Then go.
2120014016/A new era dawns. An era of super humans. None will stop me! I appoint you my new adjutant. Know your assignment?
2120014017/Excellent. What news from de Wett?
2120014018/We must fan the flames of chaos. Release more of our experiments and let the elves wreak havoc.
2120014019/Geralt of Rivia, only he stands between me and...
2120014020/Enough. Give the people more food and tell them any god-fearing human can find shelter at the castle of the Order of the Flaming Rose.
2120014021/Come, I will show you something.
2120014022/You doubt me? I do not blame you. I had my doubts, too. Yet now my vision is strong.
2120014023/The world needs a savior. A man of the moment. Someone to kindle the flame in people's hearts.
2120014024/I do not intend to deceive you. The White Frost approaches, a cataclysm that will bury the world beneath snow and ice.
2120014025/The cataclysm is unavoidable. Kings prefer to wage local wars to expand their influence, while elves have become terrorists fighting for a lost cause.
2120014026/Each night, I dream of icy wastelands and the death of the old civilizations.
2120014027/Humans are weak, frail, and inclined toward evil. I shall create a new man, perfect, tempered in the Eternal Fire.
2120014028/Behold my people. They feast at my table, find warmth at my fire, and glow with happiness to be separated from the turmoil of war.
2120014029/That sword is for monsters...
2120014030/You again? What do you want?
2120014031/Then begone! A messenger might arrive soon. You'll frighten him.
2120014032/And he likely won't if you loiter here! Begone!
2120014033/Is it true you have access to Foltest's court?
2120014034/No matter, I only wonder if you met my charming cousin, Antoinette.
2120014035/Give my regards to Antoinette!
2120014036/Witcher Geralt?
2120014037/Many thanks.
2120014038/Curses! Where is he?
2120014039/The sorceresses' lodge started these troubles.
2120014040/I find Count Roderick de Wett's presence comforting in these hard times.
2120014041/Ah, you dispelled the curse of the stri... I mean, the trouble with the princess.
2120014042/A witcher in the royal chambers! The times we live in!
2120014043/May the king burn Merigold at the stake.
2120014044/Poor Velerad. Foltest grows meaner with age.
2120014045/Why? I didn't do anything!
2120014046/Stop him!
2120014047/I should definitely...
2120014048/No, impossible...
2120014049/What's that?
2120014050/Curious...
2120014051/Huh?
2120014052/Oh my...
2120014053/Interesting...
2120014054/What did I do?
2120014055/I refuse.
2120014056/Just what we needed.
2120014057/It had to rain...
2120014058/Oo, it's raining toads.
2120014059/Raining cats and dogs!
2120014060/Stop raining!
2120014061/It rains, it pours.
2120014062/Someone help me!
2120014063/Scheme afoot...?
2120014064/So, Radovid...
2120014065/Maybe Velerad?
2120014066/Guards!
2120014067/Not just superfluous, offensive.
2120014068/Oo, it's raining.
2120014069/It was looking like rain.
2120014070/Damn, it wasn't supposed to rain!
2120014071/I didn't agree to this downpour!
2120014072/Greetings.
2120014073/I'll be watching your hands...
2120014074/Choose another table if you're not serious.
2120014075/May I ask who referred you?
2120014076/If you're any good, welcome. If you've a taste for food or drink, ask the barwench.
2120014077/Go practice elsewhere.
2120014078/Those questions attract the wrong attention. Suffice it to know this house is owned by entrepreneurs who disagree with the limitations of the emergency state. They wish to provide entertainment to the hard-working residents of the city.
2120014079/Only large wagers at this one.
2120014080/Enjoy yourself.
2120014081/Velerad has decided to turn Old Vizima into a hospice for diseased nonhumans.
2120014082/For the hundredth time, don't bother me!
2120014083/Gods! How did these monsters enter the city?!
2120014084/I shall quit trading and become a wandering acrobat.
2120014085/I detest usurers, but I require another loan.
2120014086/Where's my runner?
2120014087/I oft hear of bandits bearing the Salamander symbol.
2120014088/Ohhhh... And I shall never see my beautiful Toussaint!
2120014089/Please tell my cousin I need gold to get home!
2120014090/I see. Sacre bleu.
2120014091/You'll find Antoinette at the royal court. I beg you.
2120014092/You were at Foltest's castle recently?
2120014093/Did my... um... cousin, Antoinette, have anything for me?
2120014094/My savior.
2120014095/Witcher, I must speak with you.
2120014096/Many thanks.
2120014097/Woe is me. What shall I do?!
2120014098/Don't do that!
2120014099/Stop! At once!
2120014100/What are they scheming...?
2120014101/Redania? No...
2120014102/Who's behind this...?
2120014103/Perfect. A witcher completes this mess.
2120014104/Are you ill?
2120014105/I'd give my huntsman 5 orens for that trophy.
2120014106/You must be mistaken.
2120014107/I'm soaked...
2120014108/Right.
2120014109/Quite warm, the rain.
2120014110/I detest mobs.
2120014111/All according to plan...
2120014112/Stop! Now! At once!
2120014113/Heh heh.
2120014114/Who's behind this?
2120014115/Wait!
2120014116/Not just superfluous, offensive.
2120014117/Beautiful.
2120014118/I'm getting soaked...
2120014119/Right.
2120014120/I detest mobs.
2120014121/Chimney tax, poll tax, war tax - what else?
2120014122/So many hours waiting...
2120014123/Velerad's an honest man.
2120014124/Why did they let you into the quarter?
2120014125/I take offense.
2120014126/Leuvaarden has hired the upper floor of the New Narakort. I despise the nouveau riche.
2120014127/The Temple Quarter still reeks of the plague.
2120014128/I could've left town as Foltest's courtier.
2120014129/I shall complain to Princess Adda about the soldiers' brutality.
2120014130/Vivaldi is insolvent. What a catastrophe!
2120014131/It seems I withdrew my savings from Vivaldi's bank in time.
2120014132/Nothing breeds happiness like a good transaction.
2120014133/The Main Square hatches many rumors.
2120014134/If another soldier bothers me, I'll demonstrate what a crested nobleman can do.
2120014135/Gossip and rumors! Only palace courtiers can match market vendors.
2120014136/Princess Adda should marry, and Foltest should abdicate in favor of his son-in-law.
2120014137/Ah, the witcher who conquered the Damned Dog. Congratulations.
2120014138/Away, vagabond.
2120014139/I once trained in sword combat. Feint, dodge, lunge... Well done, no?
2120014140/The armorers' and sword makers' guilds may be the only ones without complaint.
2120014141/Craftsmen are demanding the king's return. The tanners' guild even submitted a petition.
2120014142/My diligent apprentice affords me time away from the workshop.
2120014143/They say you take youths as apprentices like we craftsmen do.
2120014144/Princess Adda should marry!
2120014145/The nobles were hit hardest by the plague.
2120014146/Rumor says that King Radovid will negotiate with Foltest.
2120014147/Cheeses most exquisite with a red Est Est Toussaint, 1228.
2120014148/That cheating dwarf is here, a Redanian spy, a witch, and a mutant. Disgraceful!
2120014149/The princess is a captivating beauty.
2120014150/Did you meet anyone who might be Antoinette's messenger?
2120014151/Leave me be.
2120014152/Impossible! My cousin would never forget about me!
2120014153/Antoinette's cousin! You must be her messenger!
2120014154/Oh, enough games! No one normal ventures into the swamp these days! Where is my gold?
2120014155/You've helped me.
2120014156/At last! Antoinette certainly took her time. Where is my gold?
2120014157/Thanks. Finally, I can return home!
2120014158/Woe is me. What shall I do?
2120014159/If you meet the messenger, tell him I await.
2120014160/Then welcome. They call me The Rock.
2120014161/Aye.
2120014162/I heard you beat Butter Bean and Fat Fred.
2120014163/You've beaten me, champ.
2120014164/Here.
2120014165/500 orens is yours.
2120014166/Congratulations, champ. Before you collect your reward, know another fight awaits...
2120014167/Go to the swamp, where you'll meet the nameless one. Choose your reward.
2120014168/Return tomorrow and lose another 500 orens.
2120014169/500 orens.
2120014170/Seems I have no worthy successors.
2120014171/Want to fight a real champion?
2120014172/Minute.
2120014173/Here.
2120014174/Don't!
2120014175/Stop!
2120014176/We must convince Foltest...
2120014177/I'll use my influences at court...
2120014178/And if they learn...?
2120014179/I've heard you befriend that beautiful sorceress.
2120014180/Both useless and offensive.
2120014181/Pity, more rain.
2120014182/Argh, why even complain? Damn weather.
2120014183/Curse this raining.
2120014184/Dammit.
2120014185/Finally, concern for our safety.
2120014186/In my youth I slew its like.
2120014187/Why? I didn't do anything!
2120014188/Stop him!
2120014189/I should definitely...
2120014190/No, impossible...
2120014191/What's that?
2120014192/Curious...
2120014193/Huh?
2120014194/Oh my...
2120014195/Interesting...
2120014196/What did I do?
2120014197/I refuse.
2120014198/Just what we needed.
2120014199/More rain...
2120014200/Oo, it's raining toads.
2120014201/Raining cats and dogs!
2120014202/It could stop raining!
2120014203/It rains, it pours.
2120014204/Halt! Don't do that!
2120014205/Sometimes I'd prefer to be a peasant.
2120014206/Stop! Now! At once!
2120014207/Waste of words.
2120014208/Indeed, noblesse oblige.
2120014209/Not just superfluous, offensive.
2120014210/Just what we needed, rain.
2120014211/Let it rain.
2120014212/Ah, I don't even feel like complaining about the weather.
2120014213/Stop raining!
2120014214/Grand Master, I must protest! As a nobleman and representative of...
2120014215/We don't need players.
2120014216/Eternal Fire! What fortune today!
2120014217/Oh! I saw your hair and feared you were my mother.
2120014218/Friends of nonhumans aren't welcome here.
2120014219/Go join your friends, the nonhumans.
2120014220/Care to play?
2120014221/A game?
2120014222/No more gambling. Starting tomorrow.
2120014223/Ruffians attacked me last night. They mentioned some lizard trying to scare me.
2120014224/I don't talk to plebes.
2120014225/I hear of marauding killers from some brotherhood of the Salamander.
2120014226/I heard of racial riots in the ghetto.
2120014227/Salamandra, the cult of the Lionheaded Spider. So many secret organizations lately.
2120014228/Geralt of Rivia? Your feats precede you!
2120014229/Commerce is booming in Cintra, unlike here.
2120014230/Merchants are complaining about bandits wearing the Salamander badge.
2120014231/My taxes support twits in city hall.
2120014232/My patience has ended.
2120014233/I prefer traditional feasts.
2120014234/They cannot expect us to stand all night.
2120014235/Triss Merigold is the most beautiful woman in the world.
2120014236/Nilfgaardian cuisine is not so bad. The chambermaids are quite fetching, too.&#13;
2120014237/Princess Adda is here.
2120014238/Old Vizima's ashes still smolder and the royal family consorts with a Nilfgaardian!
2120014239/What good is this war if decent citizens of Vizima suffer the most...
2120014240/Thank you. We couldn't have managed without you.
2120014241/Quickly... It's dangerous.
2120014242/A gift from the gods! Shani told us about you.
2120014243/Will you help us reach the hospital?
2120014244/Let's go inside the hospital...
2120014245/We tried going there, but with the fighting, we can't possibly manage alone.
2120014246/Can we help you?
2120014247/Are you mad? Shani will see us!
2120014248/Did Shani not come back with you?
2120014249/I fear Shani's jealousy.
2120014250/I would love to see you again.
2120014251/Geralt?
2120014252/This can be our little secret...
2120014253/He heard us talking...? Hallowed Melitele!
2120014254/But not now. Shani would kill us.
2120014255/You've evil eyes. Begone.
2120014256/How much more blood must be spilled?
2120014257/Don't blame the nonhumans. Troublemakers provoked them and sent them to their deaths.
2120014258/I regret my devotion to the Order.
2120014259/Can you find Naezan salts and wine stone for my poultices?
2120014260/May the Eternal Fire always light your way.
2120014261/As a witcher you must collect monster stories and I have an interest in ifrits...
2120014262/The medicine's finished. Oh, for a vial of healing brew!
2120014263/Farewell. May Melitele protect you.
2120014264/I'm afraid... The time for contempt has come, just as prophesied.
2120014265/I know you care about people. I saw Carmen, happy with the captain of the guards. You know, they got married?
2120014266/When Carmen got pregnant, he cast her out. She went to Vizima. You know how that ended...
2120014267/Then listen: The Time of White Frost and White Light approaches, the Time of Madness and Disdain, Tedd Deireadh, the End of Ages. The world will perish in frost...
2120014268/The prophecy has now begun.
2120014269/People thought the Age of the Sword and Axe, the Age of the Wolf's Blizzard, had arrived. Know the rest?
2120014270/The war with Nilfgaard proved it. For Ithlinne foretold the blood of Aen Seidhe, of elves, would drench the land.
2120014271/Greetings, witcher.
2120014272/Thanks to you, witcher. I heard you cast a spell on Vincent. That poor girl deserved a little happiness.
2120014273/Know Ithlinne's prophecy?
2120014274/Carmen endured a lot... She lived in the outskirts, her father was a priest of the Eternal Fire. A damnable man of religion...
2120014275/I'm so tired...
2120014276/Rogue!
2120014277/I surrender!
2120014278/Run!
2120014279/Stay away!
2120014280/Argh...
2120014281/Follow me!
2120014282/Mercy!
2120014283/Attack!
2120014284/No easy way out.
2120014285/Attack!
2120014286/Scoundrel!
2120014287/The rain will cleanse the city.
2120014288/Great weather!
2120014289/You waste my time.
2120014290/How's my grandmother?
2120014291/I'm not wealthy, but Shani spoke of your kindness.
2120014292/True. My grandmother - she's...
2120014293/Granny will speak to me only to warn me away from the cellar.
2120014294/The crossroads near where the peddlers stand.
2120014295/I... I don't feel like talking...
2120014296/I thank you! Shani spoke true about you.
2120014297/No. Many youngsters would envy Granny's health. She's changed, and dread fills my heart...
2120014298/I have the gold. Tell me what happened.
2120014299/Gods, how horrible.
2120014300/Remember that bluffer from room 2?
2120014301/What now?
2120014302/Died this morning.
2120014303/Pretended to the end.
2120014304/Have you given an anesthetic to the patient in 4?
2120014305/The huge dose I gave him had no effect!
2120014306/I fear his time is near.
2120014307/None of these people will survive if a remedy isn't found soon.
2120014308/It's terrifying...
2120014309/Tis no bed of roses, but why so gloomy?
2120014310/What'll happen if I'm infected?
2120014311/Touch wood they'll soon devise a remedy.
2120014312/Something happened?
2120014313/Trouble with her grandma.
2120014314/Where's the orderly?
2120014315/She takes a breather in the garden most afternoons.
2120014316/Care to stake your honor on other matters this evening?
2120014317/Hah! I was on duty all night.
2120014318/You're far too kind.
2120014319/Surely, more suitable places would welcome one so noble.
2120014320/The goddess has three faces, symbolizing her different aspects.
2120014321/A... surprising proposition.
2120014322/Helping others is my calling... and you've found... the right person. I'll shed a tear for you.
2120014323/Only nature's harvest: fruit, plants, flowers. Melitele dislikes killing done in her name.
2120014324/Three faces - that's Melitele. Behold the statue with the goddess's three faces.
2120014325/Melitele is Mother of all living things, the goddess of love, fertility and healing.
2120014326/It is well you came. The goddess is infinitely wise.
2120014327/Have you come to pray to the Great Mother?
2120014328/Melitele loves even those who go astray.
2120014329/But in the swamp is another shrine that remains unwatched. Make a sacrifice to Melitele and she will answer your prayer.
2120014330/The Eternal Fire rules the city and worshipping the Mother is forbidden.
2120014331/Does not such a person work here?
2120014332/How can I help?
2120014333/Great virtues that only few have been granted.
2120014334/A young, carefree girl; a mature, pregnant woman; and a hunched old woman.
2120014335/Vertical pupils, pale complexion... Back to bed immediately!
2120014336/Open your mouth and say aaaah...
2120014337/A medic I know says: stitch red to red, white to white, and everything will be all right.
2120014338/Did a dog run by with a liver in its mouth?
2120014339/I want to party - I'm sick of the dying!
2120014340/If only I could sleep and forget these horrors.
2120014341/I pray to Melitele daily to give me strength.
2120014342/Shove off!
2120014343/Helping others is my calling... and you've found... the right person. I'll shed a tear for you.
2120014344/May I help?
2120014345/A... surprising proposition.
2120014346/Many have died from poisonings, tongues blackened. I fear it's more than gang warfare.
2120014347/May I help?
2120014348/That's a hideous scar. Who stitched it?
2120014349/You'll be fine... I promise.
2120014350/This wound festers... I'll change the dressing.
2120014351/We'll care for this rash soon.
2120014352/Our Mother, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name...
2120014353/Great Melitele, look favourably upon our patients and spare their suffering.
2120014354/Lady, bless this house and give us strength to help these people.
2120014355/I need to live, I need to drink... My final offer is 80. Cheers.
2120014356/Ehh, two weeds for 70 orens.
2120014357/Begone, straggler!
2120014358/Pagan custom, I'll hear none of it. It's like the Reverend says: Weed it out, weed it out!
2120014359/What's it to you?
2120014360/I'll pay 50 orens. Let's drink to that.
2120014361/Deal. One last shot.
2120014362/Hell with it, at least I'll have coin for liquor...
2120014363/Ahem... He told us to question strangers.
2120014364/What? When?
2120014365/Well, I wasn't about to stay. I turned 'round so fast I nearly left me legs behind. But it was as big as a horse! Billowed smoke and sparks like a hearth...
2120014366/The fog was so dense one time I strayed to the witch's house, where a great beast stared in her window...
2120014367/The howling from the village turns my milk sour...
2120014368/Go. I don't trust you.
2120014369/You carry a sword. But they've many swords.
2120014370/Don't ask...I'd rather live.
2120014371/We drank some ale, but my memory rarely deceives me.
2120014372/You want your 80 orens? Here.
2120014373/No more drinks for you!
2120014374/Now they're big as a man with giant branches! Luckily, they're buried underground in daytime, but I'm afraid to go near.
2120014375/Let me finish! Some time ago, strange plants erupted in my garden... These plants - they're ALIVE! Useful they were, at first, devouring moles and insects...
2120014376/Speak your mind.
2120014377/Who goes there?
2120014378/I don't talk to strangers!
2120014379/A ring of the Eternal Fire. Must be from the Reverend.
2120014380/Why enter my home armed? I have nothing worth stealing!
2120014381/Forgot the most important. Seen the Reverend?
2120014382/Take it to the dwarves... I'll say no more.
2120014383/My brother's. He fought at Brenna and other places. Oh, I detest soldiers, except my brother.
2120014384/He's always thinking of me! I have this gardening problem.
2120014385/All right, here's your coin. I told you not to slay monsters while drunk at night. But you insisted. You frighten me.
2120014386/Have a drink with me, master... Gervant. I detest spies and we all know spies don't drink.
2120014387/I fear you, master Gervant. Leave me be.
2120014388/Burn the witch!
2120014389/Leave me be!
2120014390/Die, you whore!
2120014391/Help! Murderer!
2120014392/Help me!
2120014393/Why are you here?
2120014394/Sorry. Hic-cup. A little tipsy.
2120014395/Enough.
2120014396/I dream of it even now: her magic committing the murder. She should die!
2120014397/Let the bitch die in pain!
2120014398/My brother scorned her, so she did the devil's magic on me, used me to kill him - the treachery!
2120014399/She cast her spells on my brother. Wanted to steal him... and his gold.
2120014400/That bitch ruined my life.
2120014401/The Grand Master passed by with his retinue. The most beautiful sight ever...
2120014402/Help!
2120014403/Why do you stare?
2120014404/Curse them all...
2120014405/Nothing but gold...
2120014406/Please help!
2120014407/I appreciate the thought.
2120014408/It's raining.
2120014409/I'll be soaked.
2120014410/What a downpour.
2120014411/We're in for a deluge.
2120014412/Always shop with your sword?
2120014413/Another sent you.
2120014414/Why? What did I do?
2120014415/*sigh*
2120014416/Stop him!
2120014417/I should definitely do that...
2120014418/No, impossible...
2120014419/What's that?
2120014420/Curious...
2120014421/Huh?
2120014422/Oh my...
2120014423/Interesting...
2120014424/*yawn*
2120014425/*grunt*
2120014426/I didn't hurt you!
2120014427/I'd prefer something I could really use.
2120014428/Just what we needed.
2120014429/And it's raining...
2120014430/It's raining toads.
2120014431/Raining cats and dogs!
2120014432/It could stop raining!
2120014433/It rains, it pours.
2120014434/Help!
2120014435/Why do you stare?
2120014436/Ah, screw them all...
2120014437/They think of nothing but money...
2120014438/People, help!
2120014439/No. Just no.
2120014440/It's raining.
2120014441/I'm going to be all wet.
2120014442/What a downpour.
2120014443/We're in for a deluge.
2120014444/Don't hurt me, please!
2120014445/What can we do?
2120014446/Griggs are a nuisance.
2120014447/I'm getting old...
2120014448/Soon, I'll be as gray as you.
2120014449/People, help!
2120014450/Witcher, what was that?
2120014451/Here to see me?
2120014452/If I were you, I'd avoid the streets at night.
2120014453/Nowhere to drink in this town. In the slums you may pay with your life for a beer.
2120014454/They accost you, beat you, and mug you for good measure. Begone, scoundrel.
2120014455/Begone!
2120014456/Several moxes and a Black Lothos. Anyone interested?
2120014457/I've lost everything, even the right to my wife every Friday.
2120014458/Damned dwarves and their pagan games!
2120014459/I hate to lose.
2120014460/Must be how Vivaldi feels.
2120014461/What? Never seen anyone bankrupt?
2120014462/Pinch your last penny, they will!
2120014463/Begone!
2120014464/Easy come, easy go...
2120014465/Nothing for you.
2120014466/A good book, perhaps?
2120014467/Retailers enjoy good business, too.
2120014468/Sorry for my hasty judgement. Please look.
2120014469/Care to see my wares?
2120014470/Someone with powerful links - even the richest merchants are fearful. Vast quantities of weapons are requested, which could only be for Jacques de Aldersberg or the King.
2120014471/Judge for yourself.
2120014472/Forgive me. They chased me from the market when I refused to join the guild.
2120014473/Did the guild send you?
2120014474/Someone's trying to take over the guild. And I hate rules that force me to give free arms to some and refuse business with others.
2120014475/You're welcome.
2120014476/I buy and sell arms - the best in town! I've never heard a customer complain.
2120014477/How can I help?
2120014478/I'll pass along a message.
2120014479/The shareholders prefer anonymity.
2120014480/We can't keep up with orders.
2120014481/Sorry, no individual customers.
2120014482/We produce swords and hatchets of the best quality. Armor also.
2120014483/Knights purchase at their own cost. Their weapons and armor aspire to art. But how can a few knights compare with hundreds of orderly shielders?
2120014484/Recently, we filled a lucrative order to arm monastic shielders.
2120014485/Our calling is: mass, fast, and solid. A thousand farkin' spearheads for a thousand farkin' shielders! Therein lies the future of our industry.
2120014486/A factory. Were you raised in the woods?
2120014487/What...? Clients came? Oh, you...let me sleep.
2120014488/Ten thousand crossbow bolts, dog's balls!!!
2120014489/Let's not forget the arbalester.
2120014490/Sorry.
2120014491/I would tell you, but for the confidentiality clause.
2120014492/Yes?
2120014493/Confidentiality requires -- Wait... Industrial spy, are you?
2120014494/Then behold. The newest factory in Temeria. We manufacture more arms than all swordmakers combined.
2120014495/Quiet, I beg you. Certain agents I can speak with openly, while others I can't.
2120014496/I'm busy.
2120014497/I've said too much. Don't repeat this anywhere.
2120014498/Quiet... or court spies will hear us.
2120014499/You're Geralt of Rivia.
2120014500/Begone!
2120014501/Those monsters grow so big! We'll roll the catapults out of the armory.
2120014502/I'll ask the swordsmith for such a sword.
2120014503/You're a savior.
2120014504/Lucky to have two witchers visit us, ho ho. I, Tobias Hoffman, am the village chief.
2120014505/How vile. Here's the gold I promised.
2120014506/He fishes treasures from the lake, renovates them, and sends them to markets in Vizima.
2120014507/Greetings!
2120014508/What do you have for me?
2120014509/There's also the fishpeople - a scourge on our lives.
2120014510/There are more urgent matters. We'll need to discuss that another time.
2120014511/Bring proof and I'll be generous.
2120014512/He's dumber than a doornail. My daughter laughs and he starts talking marriage. I grabbed my stick...
2120014513/She's picking raspberries. Doubtless with that fool Adam.
2120014514/I have a special reward for you. You may find this runic stone useful.
2120014515/But the wedding will soon end that...
2120014516/My beloved daughters! Leave me, I wish to be alone.
2120014517/He's often sitting by the altar of the Lady of the Lake. Sometimes he's driven off by Dagon's worshippers, but he always returns.
2120014518/Dear gods, what is it? Take your 800 orens and remove that nasty thing.
2120014519/Elves live on the shore - pretty disagreeable lot. I thought to give them leftover food. They looked at me so cold I nearly froze.
2120014520/Speak.
2120014521/A creature looking like a fish with legs appears by the lake.
2120014522/Yes, my dear daughter Alina is marrying a gallant, hard working, and honest fellow.
2120014523/About what?
2120014524/Julian's in charge of that business.
2120014525/We're grateful you slew their priest. Might teach them not to mess with humans!
2120014526/I may offer more rewards soon.
2120014527/You know the joy that finding a good lad for your daughter brings? No? Thought not, fighting is all your kind thinks about!
2120014528/They got vicious, driving us away from the water, wounding some of us, and killing a few. Julian knows more.
2120014529/Well, I hope... But you can never be certain with fishpeople...
2120014530/People say they don't attack without reason, but they don't let us fish for treasure... I am certain they stole our Strawberry!
2120014531/This runic stone is said to be very powerful. Take it.
2120014532/They're a strange bunch. Still, I've enough to do here in the village without worrying about them.
2120014533/They say the crypt in the fields is home to a beast. It has huge teeth, resembles a dead mother-in-law. Horrible, they say...
2120014534/I've seen enough proof. Your 800 orens.
2120014535/Leave me. I mourn my daughters.
2120014536/I hear you slew three deadly creatures.
2120014537/Not a bad player myself. We should sit down sometime.
2120014538/Tis a popular pastime, beastie baiter.
2120014539/Five monsters lie dead. That's worthy of a reward.
2120014540/It is.
2120014541/Your reputation precedes you.
2120014542/Beastie baiter?
2120014543/What be your moniker?
2120014544/Beastie baiter, what brings you here?
2120014545/A spirit? Is there a tomb 'neath the statue?
2120014546/Good woman, whose statue stands at the lakeside?
2120014547/Is she a countess or baroness?
2120014548/Fair lasses are few in my parts.
2120014549/Barely matured, wise with experience and lacking the fickleness of youth.
2120014550/Gracious lady, rarely have I seen such a fair maiden.
2120014551/Modestly downturned eyes, and 'neath that skirt I spied a white leg.
2120014552/Then I'll partake of her hospitality.
2120014553/Milady, where can one drink around here?
2120014554/You recommend this tavern?
2120014555/It would've been a beautiful wedding...
2120014556/Everyone here is daft about their champion cow.
2120014557/I'll remember the mirage of the Sunken City forever.
2120014558/A beautiful area! The lasses are enchanting!
2120014559/I'm a distant relative of Alina. What a pleasure to meet the famous witcher Gerard of Trigia.
2120014560/These folk all tremble at the thought of the Beast. I'm frightened myself.
2120014561/The first I've seen of the walls of Temeria's capital.
2120014562/The Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose himself passed through here.
2120014563/This cursed plague will keep Vizima's gates closed for some time.
2120014564/Simple folk know a good deal, especially the elders. Some share their stories for small tokens.
2120014565/No, no missions for you!
2120014566/King Foltest raised customs duties again. This bodes ill!
2120014567/Damn Squirrels, assaulting convoys like during the war.
2120014568/Cursed plague stopped our transport outside Vizima!
2120014569/Enough. Home to Redania...
2120014570/I lose coin every day the gates remain closed.
2120014571/They won't let a hero of the war with Nilfgaard into Vizima!
2120014572/Help!
2120014573/Argh, not much for me here...
2120014574/Grant me patience.
2120014575/I'm wasting time here.
2120014576/Best prices in town!
2120014577/The royal court buys from me. Maybe you should, too?
2120014578/Murderer!
2120014579/We're growing angry.
2120014580/Damn, it's raining.
2120014581/I was sure it wouldn't rain.
2120014582/Wet and getting wetter.
2120014583/Roads'll be muddy!
2120014584/Help!
2120014585/Who's this?
2120014586/Gods, grant me patience.
2120014587/Ah, crap. I'm wasting time.
2120014588/Stop the murderer!
2120014589/That's ridiculous.
2120014590/Rain. Great.
2120014591/Damn rain.
2120014592/A wall of rain.
2120014593/The roads will be wet.
2120014594/Witcher...
2120014595/How fortunate to have met you!
2120014596/And witchers kill beasts for coin?
2120014597/My uncle was slain by swamp monsters. He bore our family ring, which I value greatly. Bring me the ring for 100 orens.
2120014598/We prayed at the chapel. When the monsters attacked, my uncle fled into the swamp near the statue of the goddess.
2120014599/They say you're a witcher.
2120014600/Many thanks! Here is your reward.
2120014601/You found it?
2120014602/Hurry! How will I face my mother?
2120014603/Cursed plague.
2120014604/Cursed plague.
2120014605/Sober?
2120014606/Got a strange gleam in your eye.
2120014607/On guard?
2120014608/Damn it all, I'd rather be in Poviss!
2120014609/Word is, a legendary witcher has returned from the grave. That bodes ill!
2120014610/Begone, freak!
2120014611/You didn't see me!
2120014612/Do you have 5 cockatrice feathers?
2120014613/Next!
2120014614/Next, please!
2120014615/Please don't hold up the queue.
2120014616/Yes?
2120014617/Thank you, now sign the receipt. Next!
2120014618/Don't bother me. I'm working. Next!
2120014619/Hurry, please!
2120014620/Tis the calm before the storm in Old Vizima. We'll soon learn the nonhumans' plans.
2120014621/A wink, was that? Plow secrecy, all know I sell information. What'll it be?
2120014622/Princess Adda was once a striga. Though the curse was undone, she still shows a wild streak.
2120014623/I heard King Radovid is meeting with Foltest in Vizima. Perhaps the customs war between the kingdoms will end. Or Foltest gains a son-in-law.
2120014624/Ruthless King Foltest governs with an iron fist. His love for his daughter is his only weakness.
2120014625/Salamandra has wrested control of the criminal underworld. The bandits have powerful allies, else they wouldn't be so untouchable.
2120014626/Once leader of the Order of the White Rose, Jacques de Aldersberg renamed it the Order of the Flaming Rose. Besides King Foltest, his authority is unmatched and his religious fervor exceeds that of fanatics.
2120014627/I'm offended.
2120014628/Lately, the merchant Leuvaarden and the sorceress Triss Merigold have been seen together. Doubtless the Merchants' Guild and the Lodge of Sorceresses have joined forces to stir up Temerian politics. I'd be fearful if I were Foltest.
2120014629/Aristocrats buy gloves, shawls, and kerchiefs for their nobly-born ladies. Noblewomen wish to keep in fashion and are constantly changing apparel.
2120014630/How can I help?
2120014631/Pleasing trifles, lovely souvenirs, luxury items.
2120014632/I sell clothing from faraway Toussaint and rings that adorn the gentle hands of aristocrats.
2120014633/Looking for a present for a lady? I don't wish to be indiscreet, so I shan't inquire further.
2120014634/Greetings, noble sir. If you seek a present for a lady, you've come to the right place.
2120014635/I supply the upper classes: beautiful ladies and noble gentlemen.
2120014636/Not so good. King Foltest left the city with the entire court and thus, my clients. Moreover, under martial law, townsfolk would rather buy food and other necessities.
2120014637/I only suggest that elegant courtesans gladly accept jewels when they would be insulted by gold. Maintaining appearances is part of their erotic game, if you understand me.
2120014638/Pray!
2120014639/From air, fire, war...
2120014640/He speaks true.
2120014641/Don't blame me!
2120014642/...great idea...
2120014643/...what can I get her?...
2120014644/...good deal...
2120014645/You? Never mind, don't care...
2120014646/Great trophy, but hide it from women.
2120014647/An armed madman! Help!
2120014648/Definitely not.
2120014649/Accursed weather.
2120014650/What a downpour.
2120014651/Quite the storm.
2120014652/Hmm... rain...
2120014653/A witcher! Hide your women!
2120014654/No reason for you to be here.
2120014655/Help!
2120014656/How could she have treated me that way?
2120014657/No, that's unforgivable...
2120014658/Should I hurry?
2120014659/Murderer! Stop the murderer!
2120014660/Oh, we're getting angry.
2120014661/Damn I hate this weather.
2120014662/It's raining, not good.
2120014663/What a downpour.
2120014664/This is serious rain.
2120014665/I've had about enough.
2120014666/Evil has crept in here.
2120014667/Their flames will drive away the demons!
2120014668/When the plague has gone. Until then, only knights of the Flaming Rose may pass through.
2120014669/Shut up! The Order will defeat the monsters.
2120014670/Wise words.
2120014671/Kikimores.
2120014672/Born of elven magic and hatred.
2120014673/Looks like.
2120014674/Due to martial law.
2120014675/I started stockpiling.
2120014676/Can't complain.
2120014677/Maybe you'll get another chance.
2120014678/That cute clerk winked at me. See that?
2120014679/I hope I have enough for the bribe...
2120014680/I've been here three times!
2120014681/Supposedly the Order bested the Scoia'tael in the swamp.
2120014682/Does Roderick de Wett truly hail from Nilfgaard?
2120014683/The say the Grand Master sired Siegfried the knight illegitimately.
2120014684/Redanians have even graced us with their presence. Master Julian entertains some fine friends.
2120014685/Far beyond Bullsville and Vizima, a land ruled by good King Radovid.
2120014686/We've saddened our Lady. Others have dreamt the same.
2120014687/The Lady bestowed abundance on us and protects Murky Waters, and we're so ungrateful.
2120014688/Indeed. Master Julian collects hunting trophies. We'll hang his wolf's head on the fence.
2120014689/The griggs play pranks more than ever.
2120014690/Fool, witchers don't care about griggs.
2120014691/We've started training Strawberry to pose, heh heh...
2120014692/Prime, though they've overfed her.
2120014693/She'll win. That rash on her udder has disappeared.
2120014694/Which grand lords are in conflict now?
2120014695/How do you know?
2120014696/This turmoil will pass us by, as usual.
2120014697/The Reverend ordered a collection for the new chapels to the Eternal Fire.
2120014698/I shudder to think where the stall-keeper finds her meat.
2120014699/Odo's brother would've protected us from the Beast.
2120014700/I witnessed that ghost biting a townswoman's head off.
2120014701/Yesterday the drowned dead took another child.
2120014702/Another witcher? What terrible times.
2120014703/Mark my words, the elves will bring trouble.
2120014704/I hope Julian takes over for that arse Hoffman.
2120014705/A witcher? Tend to those noonwraiths in the field.
2120014706/Adam's been arrested! I knew he'd end badly. Oh, those artists...
2120014707/The vodyanoi are an ancient race, who worship their own gods.
2120014708/What an odd race. Have you heard of their intelligence?
2120014709/The vodyan priests, uh, pray to various gods. Our fathers spoke of humongous creatures, lords of the underwater realms.
2120014710/Of course. Surely a witcher knows.
2120014711/Thank you, I'm proud of my knowledge.
2120014712/They bear the respect of their people, even more so because they know magic.
2120014713/Julian is a fool. May the day never come when his stupidity spells disaster for the village.
2120014714/For they ignore us as we do worms beneath our feet. If they directed anger against us, all would be lost.
2120014715/The deep is home to intelligent beings. We should leave them in peace.
2120014716/The treasures of the Underwater City should remain at the bottom. That idiot Julian has no idea what disturbing lake waters might bring.
2120014717/Many priests also pay homage to the Lady of the Lake.
2120014718/Foltest sent you to tend to our problems with the fishpeople?
2120014719/I wished to reach the island, but that growling fisherman refused to take me.
2120014720/Alvin admires you.
2120014721/Did the Lady of the Lake appear to you?
2120014722/That pendant you gave Alvin... he believes it a real witcher's medallion.
2120014723/You allied with enemies of your own race. For shame.
2120014724/I saw demons born of moonlight, wind, and the soil cooled after a day's heat. They hovered over the ground raving.
2120014725/Midnight demons emerge when the moon is high. I dream they carry me through the air, dance around me, then let me fall.
2120014726/I swore never to venture into the fields at night.
2120014727/When one gazed at me, I ran as fast as my legs could carry me.
2120014728/One night, I saw nightwraiths dancing in the fields. Even as I say this, I feel my flesh creep.
2120014729/What heat! May the sun set quickly, though recently I've had terrible dreams of nightwraiths.
2120014730/I beg you, don't hurt me!
2120014731/I'm exhausted.
2120014732/Woe is me...
2120014733/What do I spy?
2120014734/Don't!
2120014735/Why that?
2120014736/What horrid weather!
2120014737/Will it stop raining?
2120014738/Wretched weather.
2120014739/Can't see.
2120014740/My herbs cure every illness.
2120014741/Care for tea?
2120014742/By the gods! Don't hurt me!
2120014743/Oh, I'm in pain.
2120014744/I'm exhausted.
2120014745/Hm. What have we here...?
2120014746/No, please don't!
2120014747/Someone else might agree. Not I.
2120014748/Terrible weather!
2120014749/Can't rain any harder than this.
2120014750/Wretched weather.
2120014751/Can't see a thing.
2120014752/Speak softly or someone will spot us together.
2120014753/Oh! That's a hefty sum. Profiting off someone else's misery! Well, deal with him and I'll pay.
2120014754/My husband haunts me. What do I do?
2120014755/You're depriving a widow of her pittance!
2120014756/Have you proof?
2120014757/Damn you! Take your gold and begone.
2120014758/My husband died a month since and now haunts me in my home, wailing nightly. But the worst thing is...
2120014759/My late husband haunts me!
2120014760/I'm here every day at noon.
2120014761/Are you daft? My husband flies around ruining my reputation - I'll not be seen in the company of a killer!
2120014762/Oooaa... Woe is me! Will no one help me?
2120014763/Worst... he flies around the cemetery at night shouting lies about me. Doubtless tongues are wagging already. Set him straight, I beg you.
2120014764/My husband? Has he...? You know...?
2120014765/Oh, I wish...
2120014766/Easier said than done.
2120014767/Nonhumans are behind the evil here!
2120014768/How rude!
2120014769/I tire of this.
2120014770/I prefer enjoying myself.
2120014771/I dreamt the city sank as fire consumed it.
2120014772/Others dreamt as I did!
2120014773/You look fabulous.
2120014774/What a lovely frock.
2120014775/I apologize for yesterday.
2120014776/So all's well?
2120014777/What did you want?
2120014778/I'll help.
2120014779/Yes?
2120014780/Sonny! Why ask that?
2120014781/Everyone's fearful. The district has ground to a halt.
2120014782/Only in the Trade Quarter can you find foreign goods.
2120014783/My beau habitually returns drunk.
2120014784/I'd rather not speak.
2120014785/Certainly.
2120014786/Why?
2120014787/Why do you gaze at me?
2120014788/Gladly would I help.
2120014789/I never deal with the likes of you.
2120014790/Prices are sky-high under martial law!
2120014791/Such impertinence!
2120014792/Help! Murderer!
2120014793/Help me!
2120014794/Drink?
2120014795/Definitely not.
2120014796/Who the devil...?
2120014797/What can I do for you?
2120014798/You have done well cleansing your households of sin. I know it was difficult. I know they be kin. But the Eternal Fire sent pestilence on them as punishment for their sins! You are pure. You shall live! And we believed him... then went outside.
2120014799/We began by cleansing our homes of sin and filth. We gathered it up and by the next day, all our foulness was buried or gone. The Reverend then spoke to all who remained:
2120014800/The plague was devastating. People died in droves. The wailing lingered for three moons. If not for the Reverend, we'd all have perished.
2120014801/The Reverend prayed all day to the Eternal Fire, taking no sustenance. His penance freed us from sin and strengthened our faith.
2120014802/No wonder we're wary of strangers. You don't know what it's like when the plague takes your family...
2120014803/The next day the village was quiet, as if all were asleep. Fewer have fallen sick since.
2120014804/Daaa, by the Eternal Fire!
2120014805/N...no.
2120014806/Everyone drink up! We're closing.
2120014807/Very well. I'll see what I have.
2120014808/What do you want?
2120014809/Your kind's not welcome here...
2120014810/We have no more.
2120014811/The frost was biting, but we did our penance, crawling 'round the village, praying at the five chapels.
2120014812/No, ask the Reverend.
2120014813/Yes. For you - 5 orens.
2120014814/Zoltan Chivay, a nonhuman, speaks of dice all the time.
2120014815/Look around the tables, but at night guests retire to their rooms. Return tomorrow if you must talk to 'em.
2120014816/Do I look like I'd engage in child's play?
2120014817/I don't talk to strangers.
2120014818/For that, I'd talk to a barghest all day.
2120014819/Off with you, or I'll give you the boot!
2120014820/That elven bitch Toruviel fled, tail between her legs.
2120014821/Saint Gregory's bones rest in the old seat of the supreme and sacred inquisition, long forgotten and locked shut. Perhaps the saint's legend will aid you.
2120014822/Heretics killed Saint Gregory, an inquisitor, to avenge the kin purified with the Eternal Fire. Gregory awaited them in the temple, armed with his words of faith and an axe named Meatcutter!
2120014823/Indeed. Behold this masterpiece! Take care not to scratch it too much in battle.
2120014824/Greetings, sir.
2120014825/Never! Nonhumans worship nasty little gods, their inventions are inspired by devils.
2120014826/Good armor has saved the life of many a soul these last few days.
2120014827/Of course.
2120014828/A pure pleasure.
2120014829/I've seen dwarven scrolls on forging techniques, that's all.
2120014830/Ah, White Rayla, may the Eternal Fire guide her fighting arm. You must be a friend.
2120014831/How can I help?
2120014832/Good to see you again.
2120014833/The legend contains the clue to opening the temple door. I would try various element-based spells.
2120014834/Eternal Fire, I shall forge a sacred suit of armor!
2120014835/Bring me the armor of Graf Cobus Ruyter, the notes of an elven songmaster, the Litany of the Sacred Flame, and the remaining pieces of Raven's suit of armor.
2120014836/Return tomorrow.
2120014837/The mob twice assaulted the saint like a wailing wind, but he did not bow! When the saint spoke the litany, the Eternal Fire turned the vile heretics to ash. Gregory then sealed himself inside the temple and expired from his wounds.
2120014838/The Litany of the Sacred Flame! By these words, Saint Gregory summoned the Eternal Fire!!!
2120014839/Not so fast... Its maker used vile magic! Besides, the spaulder, rerebrace, and gauntlet alone remain. Hmmm... but if you bring me the components, I could...
2120014840/I can replace elven songs with prayers to the Eternal Fire... but you must bring me both the notes of an elven songmaster and the Litany of the Sacred Flame...
2120014841/The remaining parts of Raven's suit plus the armor it inspired, that of Graf Cobus Ruyter. The graf fell at Brenna and was buried in the swamp cemetery.
2120014842/Witcher! They said some dwarf slashed you with his axe!
2120014843/Beware, rebels may still lurk among the ruins.
2120014844/No small task restoring order in the city.
2120014845/I never doubted the Order's victory.
2120014846/A witcher will find much work here.
2120014847/So... cold.
2120014848/Damn the pain!
2120014849/Damnable elves! I curse them and their arrows!
2120014850/Fall back!
2120014851/Fight!
2120014852/Argh.
2120014853/Yield!
2120014854/Die, rogue!
2120014855/No further. Understood?!
2120014856/Eternal Fire, fill my heart.
2120014857/Follow me, whoever stands!
2120014858/Defend yourself!
2120014859/Whosoever loveth the Eternal Fire, attack!
2120014860/Attack! At them!
2120014861/What's this?
2120014862/Definitely not.
2120014863/Retreat! Fall back!
2120014864/Fight!
2120014865/Argh.
2120014866/Desist!
2120014867/Die, rogue!
2120014868/No further. Understood?!
2120014869/Eternal Fire, fill my heart.
2120014870/Follow me, all who stand!
2120014871/Defend yourself!
2120014872/Whosoever loveth the Eternal Fire, attack!
2120014873/Attack! At them!
2120014874/What's that?
2120014875/No.
2120014876/No, to support a just cause and prevent a massacre like that in the Outskirts. And to save your friends from ravenous beasts.
2120014877/I'll put it in your terms: monsters infest the village, hunt its inhabitants. They are destitute and hungry, and all the more dangerous for that. Stand with Rayla, witcher. With the Order, against these monsters.
2120014878/Rayla is an excellent officer and truly detests nonhumans. Perfect to lead this mission...
2120014879/We foiled the robbery at Vivaldi's bank and the Scoia'tael are weakened. We can afford the best merceneries, yet we cannot trust Rayla as we trust you.
2120014880/As White Rayla's adjutant, I would like a word with you, witcher.
2120014881/Well, I've ne'er seen a more beauteous woman...
2120014882/Greetings, nurse. You're ravishing today.
2120014883/It'd be a pleasure.
2120014884/What matters comfort? I'd give the world to be cared for by you.
2120014885/Wouldn't mind taking ill here.
2120014886/And you're beautiful beyond words.
2120014887/That swamp reeks.
2120014888/We're at your command.
2120014889/Mission accomplished. Return to base?
2120014890/Begone!
2120014891/Need anything?
2120014892/A while ago. My father was an armorer and I after him.
2120014893/Go away, atheist!
2120014894/Come back later.
2120014895/Siegfried's friends are always welcome. If you want to buy something, speak to my apprentice. I handle forging and special orders.
2120014896/Are you the one Siegfried spoke of?
2120014897/Thanks. I'll be sure it goes to a worthy cause.
2120014898/Then stop bothering me.
2120014899/I only work for friends of the Order.
2120014900/What's that?
2120014901/We help fight the plague, keep the peace, and fight monsters.
2120014902/We protect the people and bear the light of the eternally Flaming Rose.
2120014903/It is you! That cockatrice troubled us for ages. I heard it was a hard fight.
2120014904/Say, 70 orens?
2120014905/Should've said. But no - I'm a swordsmith and devote my time to the Order.
2120014906/Come back later, I can't start just now.
2120014907/Yes.
2120014908/What's your business?
2120014909/The Rose Flame will purify you.
2120014910/May the Rose burn eternally!
2120014911/I honor you - you protect the faithful from monsters.
2120014912/We must speak in daylight. Dangers abound now.
2120014913/In the war I served under Bronibor in the PFI.
2120014914/Halt! No passage through here!
2120014915/Not even the Emperor of Nilfgaard can pass! Captain's orders!
2120014916/Halt! No passage through here!
2120014917/Until further notice.
2120014918/Those are my orders!
2120014919/Report to Siegfried.
2120014920/Nice oar. Oh, a sword! My mistake.
2120014921/Begone.
2120014922/With the tavern under surveillance, tread carefully.
2120014923/Talk to Siegfried.
2120014924/The gods have rejected witchers - and rightly so.
2120014925/Wait... you massacred those bandits?
2120014926/Witcher Geralt? Siegfried spoke of you.
2120014927/May the Eternal Fire burn in your heart.
2120014928/Departing one's home is absolutely forbidden!
2120014929/Walking the streets after sunset is forbidden!
2120014930/Am I a goddamn witcher - chasing after monsters?
2120014931/As long as those monstrosities lay low.
2120014932/De Wett will never let this go...
2120014933/...what's happening?...
2120014934/...you underestimate Thaler...
2120014935/...Thaler's in for it...
2120014936/You don't belong here.
2120014937/Where are those monstrosities from?
2120014938/It's our moral duty to defend this city.
2120014939/The Order has strengthened Vizima's defense.
2120014940/For the Flaming Rose!
2120014941/Enough lies! Attack!
2120014942/I've never seen its like.
2120014943/A knight shouldn't gaze upon such things.
2120014944/I... question my vow of celibacy...
2120014945/We received information that terrorists found shelter at the old town hall! Keep out of this, witcher!
2120014946/Then make it an honorable fight, sorcerer! Iron, no magic!
2120014947/I repeat, walk away! We'll arrest that elven bitch and clean up the old town hall!
2120014948/Arrest and question all nonhumans!
2120014949/Our commander, White Rayla! Seize them!
2120014950/The Eternal Fire speaks through the Grand Master.
2120014951/Kill the nonhumans! Leave the redheaded bitch alive!
2120014952/We must attack the barricade and hold it until reinforcements arrive. Retreat and the Scoia'tael will control almost all of Old Vizima.
2120014953/Smash the nonhumans!
2120014954/What's happening?
2120014955/Die, monster!
2120014956/Aiding Squirrels spells treason! Humble yourself before the Eternal Fire. Confess your sins and perhaps you will be spared torture!
2120014957/Save your devilish tricks, freak! The Eternal Fire shields our souls from filthy magic!
2120014958/Eternal Fire! Behold the terrorist hideout! At them!
2120014959/Baptized by fire, Vizima will arise purified!
2120014960/We'll wait outside.
2120014961/Begone. You will not enter.
2120014962/Victory!
2120014963/No mercy!
2120014964/I surrender!
2120014965/Retreat in formation!
2120014966/On your knees, knave!
2120014967/Walk away, I feel benevolent.
2120014968/Oof, I'm tired.
2120014969/Charge!
2120014970/For the Grand Master!
2120014971/Attack! The glory of the Order!
2120014972/Argh.
2120014973/Pure impertinence!
2120014974/What do you want, traitor?
2120014975/We await reinforcements from Vizima.
2120014976/Another victory! You did well, witcher.
2120014977/The peasants will be interrogated and the traitors judged. We'll move on then, there are Scoia'tael in the surrounding woods.
2120014978/Those elves will threaten no one.
2120014979/Let us pray for our fallen brothers' souls.
2120014980/Damned elves demanded a high price for their souls.
2120014981/Another victory for the Order!
2120014982/The Eternal Fire inspired our victory!
2120014983/Indeed, though some stragglers may hide here and there.
2120014984/Good that you survived. Many of ours fell, but we were victorious.
2120014985/No matter. Vizima will rise from the ashes cleansed. Let the lairs of the terrorists and heathens burn.
2120014986/Looters! Once we've slain the nonhumans, they're next.
2120014987/You're no knight, but your sword's welcome.
2120014988/Siegfried commended you. Keep safe.
2120014989/With more like you, we'd easily handle the nonhumans.
2120014990/Ghouls are nearly upon the still warm corpses. Gods be with you, Geralt!
2120014991/Death to nonhumans!
2120014992/The only good elf is a dead elf.
2120014993/The Eternal Fire guides my fighting arm.
2120014994/The Order is always victorious!
2120014995/I'm ready to fight!
2120014996/The light of the Eternal Fire protects us from the treacherous magic and vile rituals of nonhumans!
2120014997/Eternal Fire, what monstrosities are these?
2120014998/A bog in my boots. Welcome to the army.
2120014999/Accursed mosquito got me again!
2120015000/Beware of drowners. They draw people under water.
2120015001/Eternal Fire, guide my sword!
2120015002/Attack!!!
2120015003/At them!
2120015004/Charge!
2120015005/Filthy nonhumans!
2120015006/There's another path... through the sewers... dangerous... I have a key... Take it.
2120015007/You won't... a zeugl...
2120015008/We couldn't break through... heavy fighting...
2120015009/Argh...
2120015010/Shove off. The Grand Master seeks solitude.
2120015011/Halt! No passage! Grand Master's orders!
2120015012/Surrender!
2120015013/Death!
2120015014/Mercy! I beg your pardon!
2120015015/Retreat in formation!
2120015016/On my honor, one more step and things will get serious.
2120015017/Everyone follow me, no complaining!
2120015018/Kill the lackeys! At them!
2120015019/Tandaradei!
2120015020/Enemies in sight!
2120015021/Seek to amuse me?
2120015022/Kill the witcher.
2120015023/Surrender!
2120015024/Death!
2120015025/Kill the lackeys! At them!
2120015026/Tandaradei!
2120015027/We're at your command.
2120015028/We'll rout those nonhumans.
2120015029/Mission accomplished. Return to base?
2120015030/For the Ooooordeeeer!!!
2120015031/For the Flaming Rose!!!
2120015032/In the name of honor!
2120015033/You! Stop!
2120015034/No, but all new edicts bear his seal.
2120015035/Your pass!
2120015036/Complain to the king.
2120015037/Don't do anything stupid.
2120015038/We only tolerate your kind.
2120015039/We're watching you.
2120015040/Deal. Good luck, witcher.
2120015041/All right. I'll let it go. Take this pass.
2120015042/Who roams at night?!
2120015043/Carry a pass, witcher?!
2120015044/Show your pass! ... All right.
2120015045/This letter allows you to enter Vizima, not to roam at night!
2120015046/None are allowed outside at night!
2120015047/We enforce a curfew from dusk til dawn. First the plague, and now a swarm of kikimores...
2120015048/Who roams at night?!
2120015049/Retreat! Fall back!
2120015050/For victory!
2120015051/Wouldna mind an ale.
2120015052/Don't kill me!
2120015053/Taste the Order's steel!
2120015054/Back, or I'll pepper you with bolts!
2120015055/An order's an order.
2120015056/Enemy in sight!
2120015057/I'll lead you!
2120015058/Die already!
2120015059/Enemies in sight!
2120015060/Wasting my time.
2120015061/That swamp reeks.
2120015062/We're at your command.
2120015063/Mission accomplished. Return to base?
2120015064/Nurse?
2120015065/Yes, I doubt those butchers would have spared us.
2120015066/Most of the city folk care neither for the Order nor the elves. They just want peace.
2120015067/We met at St. Lebioda's Hospital in the Temple Quarter.
2120015068/Knights of the Order and Scoia'tael are fighting in every street and square. Their rule is: if you're not with us, you're against us.
2120015069/We have much work, but we'll find time for you... should you ask.
2120015070/Oh my! He heard everything! The famed witchers' senses...
2120015071/But afterwards, we'll pray together...
2120015072/What are you doing here?
2120015073/I'm so tired...
2120015074/Fall back!
2120015075/I surrender!
2120015076/Run!
2120015077/Stay away!
2120015078/Eternal Fire, light my way.
2120015079/Follow me!
2120015080/Mercy!
2120015081/Attack!
2120015082/No easy way out.
2120015083/Attack!
2120015084/For the Order!
2120015085/Frightful weather.
2120015086/Terrible weather!
2120015087/I don't need that.
2120015088/Seeking to offend me?
2120015089/Rayla feared attacking the elves, so was stripped of her command.
2120015090/Heheh, we nailed an elf to a door, then tossed him into a bonfire.
2120015091/Our prayers have been answered. The Order of the Flaming Rose is invincible!
2120015092/These looters present a problem.
2120015093/Thieves and looters everywhere!
2120015094/They say the elves suffer defeat in other quarters, too.
2120015095/We'll defeat the nonhumans with superior organization and logistics. And the Eternal Fire, of course.
2120015096/You need supplies?
2120015097/Certainly, but nothing's free. Our guards need provisions too.
2120015098/Fall back!
2120015099/Fight!
2120015100/Argh.
2120015101/Yield!
2120015102/Die, you rogue!
2120015103/No further. Understood?
2120015104/Eternal Fire, fill my heart.
2120015105/Follow me, whoever stands!
2120015106/Defend yourself!
2120015107/Whosoever loveth the Eternal Fire, attack!
2120015108/Attack! At them!
2120015109/What's this?
2120015110/I don't find that funny.
2120015111/We're at your command.
2120015112/The Order of the Flaming Rose always wins!
2120015113/Mission accomplished. Return to base?
2120015114/That swamp reeks.
2120015115/The Order of the Flaming Rose always wins!
2120015116/We'll rout those nonhumans.
2120015117/Siegfried spoke of you.
2120015118/The strength within us will heal the world.
2120015119/We give our lives to the Order.
2120015120/We must speak in daylight. Dangers abound now.
2120015121/The Eternal Fire lights my way.
2120015122/You know who I am... ahem, I thought that scroll had disappeared for good.
2120015123/For two orens I'll clean your shoes.
2120015124/Greetings, sir.
2120015125/Right away.
2120015126/Ask merchants. There's also trouble at the graveyard.
2120015127/I prefer cash, ahem, but that'll do.
2120015128/First journey to Vizima?
2120015129/You'll have no trouble finding work.
2120015130/We've some heavy issues here.
2120015131/Lots of work...
2120015132/The plague pushed the King to establish a quarantine, which plagues the merchants.
2120015133/They operate with brutal but effective force, mainly at night. Their goal remains unclear.
2120015134/Everyone hides skeletons in the closet. Let me tend to your boots. I've bored you long enough.
2120015135/The Scoia'tael wage a guerilla war outside town. The Order of the Flaming Rose replaced the special forces.
2120015136/There's a quarantine because of the plague. Squirrels are fighting the Order. Monsters breed in hundreds. And we struggle with bandits.
2120015137/As one bard sang, Vizima's like a brothel on fire.
2120015138/Hatred for nonhumans grows daily. You needn't be psychic to see something evil's afoot.
2120015139/Something odd there.
2120015140/Old Vizima was sealed off. Unfortunately, townsfolk are falling ill here. They bundle them off to Lebioda's Hospital.
2120015141/A shoeshine. Clean that muck off your boots for just 2 orens.
2120015142/We boast merchants, an alchemist, a large hospital.
2120015143/The elderly, ahem, esteem it... Pilfered it off some-- ahem, at a shelter.
2120015144/How can I thank you, ahem... This Ring of the Prophet Lebioda is my only thing of value.
2120015145/Shine your shoes!!!
2120015146/Scary!
2120015147/Peekaboo!
2120015148/Hehehe!
2120015149/What's that?
2120015150/Come from Bullsville?
2120015151/Mama likes you.
2120015152/Nasty.
2120015153/Help, Papa!
2120015154/Big deal.
2120015155/Aaa... it's raining...
2120015156/Everything's wet.
2120015157/Go ahead and rain.
2120015158/So muddy...
2120015159/They wanted to take us away from our parents.
2120015160/Please don't hurt me.
2120015161/I'm scared!
2120015162/I'm not playing that.
2120015163/And what's that?
2120015164/What's that?
2120015165/Daddy! Help!
2120015166/That's poop. I don't want it.
2120015167/Aaa... it's raining...
2120015168/Everything's getting wet.
2120015169/Go ahead and rain.
2120015170/It's going to be so muddy.
2120015171/Oooo!!!! You're weird!
2120015172/Your hair's like milk. How come?
2120015173/You're huge and ugly.
2120015174/Leave me be!
2120015175/Mother hates me speaking with strangers.
2120015176/Quickly!
2120015177/Hurry!
2120015178/The bank's been robbed! Master Velerad said we should fetch a witcher!
2120015179/Follow me, Master Geralt!
2120015180/There's a bank robbery!
2120015181/Master witcher!
2120015182/Proceed.
2120015183/Master Dandelion! You're to play at my wedding...
2120015184/Stop!... stop. Celina... killed me. My soul shall know no peace until I am avenged.
2120015185/Celina, don't blame yourself. I know you never intended to kill me.
2120015186/I must gather raspberries for my beloved.
2120015187/Love is suffering, a pain that pierces my soul like a spear... Where is my beloved? Come, rest in the sun...
2120015188/Adam, is that you?
2120015189/Alina?
2120015190/I'm to marry soon, but I must see my lover one last time. How sad he'll be if I bring him no sweet raspberries...
2120015191/Why do you say so? I feel wonderful, if a trifle cold.
2120015192/It's...
2120015193/...Follow the noonwraith, come with me...
2120015194/I am Alina. I must hurry. I am to marry soon...
2120015195/You lie! I shall scratch your eyes out!
2120015196/I can see you, my dear Adam... so you must be dead.
2120015197/Now I know I love you more than life itself...
2120015198/I carried a shawl full of juicy, sun-drenched raspberries for my beloved. Have you seen my shawl, wanderer? I lost it...
2120015199/Ah, my dear sister, I cried on your shoulder... Why?
2120015200/I must take these raspberries to my beloved.
2120015201/Why do I feel so cold?
2120015202/I love you like a... with all my heart. I cannot leave this place, my love, until I am avenged.
2120015203/Oh, Adam, how romantic!
2120015204/I must gather raspberries...
2120015205/The sun rocks the earth, grain falls from the stalk. Come away with me, wanderer, come away with the noonwraith.
2120015206/I must take these raspberries to my beloved.
2120015207/I love you like a ... with all my heart. I cannot leave this place, my love, until I am avenged.
2120015208/Adam, is that you?
2120015209/I can see you, my dear Adam... so you must be dead.
2120015210/Now I know I love you more than life itself...
2120015211/Oh, Adam, how romantic!
2120015212/The sun rocks the earth, grain falls from the stalk. Come away with me, wanderer, come away with the noonwraith.
2120015213/Eternal Fire...
2120015214/Convert! Repent now or be whipped for eternity by the White Blizzard!
2120015215/As was foretold: there will come a man who will lead you toward the light!
2120015216/The White Frost will engulf the world and encase your souls in ice!
2120015217/Death is a queen, but the end of her rule is nigh, I tell you!
2120015218/By all that is sacred!
2120015219/Time to pray.
2120015220/I'll break your bones!
2120015221/I surrender!
2120015222/Run!
2120015223/No further, blasphemer!
2120015224/Hm.
2120015225/I'll lead you!
2120015226/Mercy!
2120015227/Attack!
2120015228/I'll look right through you!
2120015229/Onward! At them, my flock!
2120015230/Awful weather.
2120015231/What did that mean?
2120015232/A scourge of the lords, this rain.
2120015233/Accept this blessing.
2120015234/I'll pray for you.
2120015235/We are all sinners, but the Eternal Fire will consume our sins.
2120015236/Donations are always rewarded.
2120015237/Said your prayers today?
2120015238/Begone, heretic!
2120015239/Another worshipper of that pagan idol!
2120015240/What is it?
2120015241/The statue of Melitele should be removed from the hospital. The Eternal Fire is the true god!
2120015242/I have little time for you godless creatures.
2120015243/Only the Eternal Fire can defeat the plague.
2120015244/May the Eternal Fire burn away your sins and vanquish your illness.
2120015245/Fire that burns in us all, grant us strength to vanquish our weaknesses.
2120015246/If your time comes, may you burn beside the Eternal Fire.
2120015247/I've never heard that before, though it's possible. The little medic will care for you.
2120015248/Shame. Ah, now I remember... Geralt of Rivia. I hired you in Novigrad to rid my storage of garkains.
2120015249/I hadn't sufficient coin, but you helped me nonetheless.
2120015250/I've no work for you.
2120015251/Have we met?
2120015252/Here's 100 orens.
2120015253/My business has grown, so I'll pay this old debt.
2120015254/Most of the diseased have died off, but the Beast and bandits now spread their own terror. All we're missing are tax collectors.
2120015255/Yes?
2120015256/What a despicable place. I'm trapped here with my goods while my wife and children wait in the city.
2120015257/Greetings.
2120015258/Heheh, royal officials would make a true feast for the Beast. And other ghosts serve it, apparently in the form of untiring bloodhounds.
2120015259/I overheard it described as a phantom, appearing from nowhere, murdering those with a heavy conscience.
2120015260/My grandfather claimed the same, insisting all the while that his bubonic ulcers were merely boils.
2120015261/Vizima's gates are closed due to the plague. The gods be my witness, nothing ruins trade like an epidemic.
2120015262/What of it? 'Tis some variety of the bubonic. To be safe, I avoid any who appear even slightly ill. Aren't you afraid?
2120015263/Never met them. But if they are a sect, the Reverend ought to know something.
2120015264/Indeed. They call themselves the militia and extort bribes. Also, some sect from Vizima may have arrived here.
2120015265/Noooo!
2120015266/That's no bargain, that's rubbish...
2120015267/I should give him an IOU...
2120015268/I need to save more...
2120015269/Seeking enlightenment? Looking for miracles? Behold my wares.
2120015270/Somebody help me!
2120015271/Shove off with that thing.
2120015272/It's raining.
2120015273/Horrible weather.
2120015274/Damn rain.
2120015275/Damn, it's raining.
2120015276/Traveler, pause, catch your breath, look upon what you can get almost for free.
2120015277/Help!
2120015278/Why did she treat me so?
2120015279/No rush.
2120015280/Should I hurry?
2120015281/Shall we deal?
2120015282/See what I have on offer?
2120015283/Murderer!
2120015284/We're growing angry.
2120015285/I hate this weather.
2120015286/What a downpour.
2120015287/The rain's really pouring.
2120015288/Argh... rain...
2120015289/Noooo!
2120015290/That would never happen back home in Redania...
2120015291/Damned Temeria...
2120015292/Pretty screwy country...
2120015293/Nothing personal against witchers, but you shouldn't walk the city streets.
2120015294/Someone help me!
2120015295/I won't even bother commenting.
2120015296/It's raining.
2120015297/Abhorrent weather.
2120015298/Drat, it's raining.
2120015299/Not good, it's raining.
2120015300/You look neither Temerian nor Redanian...
2120015301/Don't hurt me!
2120015302/Why hello.
2120015303/I'll save more...
2120015304/Terrible times...
2120015305/Please help!
2120015306/Take it and shove off.
2120015307/More rain.
2120015308/Nasty weather.
2120015309/Curse the rain.
2120015310/Not good, it's raining.
2120015311/Radovid makes a better ruler than Foltest.
2120015312/Redania and Temeria are feuding over trade.
2120015313/We needed guards due to those damned thieves.
2120015314/The brick shipment runs late again.
2120015315/All falls on me to do.
2120015316/Nilfgaardian goods are shoddy and inexpensive.
2120015317/Leuvaarden advised me to sell my shares in the transport company.
2120015318/Shove off!
2120015319/Not a moment's rest!
2120015320/Begone!
2120015321/What can I do for you?
2120015322/If you need no jewelry yourself, what of others? They're excellent gifts and worth three times the gold.
2120015323/Trinkets, baubles, anything you need!
2120015324/Come back tomorrow.
2120015325/Jewelry, ladies' apparel, precious stones...
2120015326/So those bastards want a quarantine! Who'll pay for the goods they confiscate?
2120015327/Begone, freak!
2120015328/Farkin' disease! I've been trapped in town for a week.
2120015329/Greetings, sir. Can I help?
2120015330/Forgive me, sir, we sell only to the Order's friends and to the faithful... I've not heard of you.
2120015331/Sir. I sweep up, fire the furnaces, run the shop...
2120015332/Sir?
2120015333/As you wish...
2120015334/Jewelry, gifts, trinkets and baubles!
2120015335/As do I.
2120015336/No - the phantoms that serve her.
2120015337/They're called barghests.
2120015338/When Foltest returns, I'll submit a complaint regarding those officials.
2120015339/Madness! The King keeps sending contradictory orders to his officials.
2120015340/I must use all my influence to accomplish anything.
2120015341/Scandalous! Such is the Temerian bureaucracy of late.
2120015342/Geralt of Rivia, I presume?
2120015343/Think the knights' shields will protect you from the wrath of Salamandra? You're deluded.
2120015344/You have befriended nonhumans, those outcasts.
2120015345/You insulted me.
2120015346/You're a pawn. The situation overwhelms you. Withdraw while you still have time.
2120015347/Nonhumans will perish in Salamandra's flames. Will you turn to ash with them? Turn from your path.
2120015348/Think elven arrows and dwarven battleaxes can protect you from the wrath of Salamandra?
2120015349/Don't play with fire. No one has ever beaten Salamandra.
2120015350/I have a message from mutual friends. "Don't meddle in affairs that do not concern you."
2120015351/The time will come to demonstrate your sympathy for the right side.
2120015352/They'll be ready.
2120015353/Go on.
2120015354/Calm yourself, I'm a mere messenger...
2120015355/Fret not, your paths will cross.
2120015356/Witcher Geralt... I'm surprised to see you alive.
2120015357/Sure?
2120015358/A fine opportunity to recover your losses.
2120015359/Time passes faster in good company.
2120015360/Many aren't fond of witchers, but I value your fraternity.
2120015361/At last, some respite.
2120015362/Everybody knows elves are scum.
2120015363/He's liable to enjoy it. Ha ha.
2120015364/Morden's the man.
2120015365/Remind me.
2120015366/Strike me dead!
2120015367/Vizima needs an aqueduct! I shall present plans to the council.
2120015368/We cannot all be city counselors.
2120015369/That dwarven loan shark dared to demand repayment.
2120015370/No money? We need only raise taxes.
2120015371/In that box?!
2120015372/Why are you here?!
2120015373/The wine does taste watered down.
2120015374/Gladly!
2120015375/How dare you?! Do you know who I am?!
2120015376/Ahem... I'd best be going...
2120015377/That Alina sure catches my eye.
2120015378/Strange, you don't speak like one from Rivia.
2120015379/Such a long journey here, I must get soused.
2120015380/Come no closer to the king!
2120015381/We are the royal guards.
2120015382/Halt!
2120015383/Victory or death!
2120015384/Tough life.
2120015385/Attack! At them!
2120015386/Melitele, guide my arm!
2120015387/No, please!
2120015388/Fall back!
2120015389/Stay way! That's forbidden!
2120015390/Duty calls.
2120015391/Follow me!
2120015392/Get him!
2120015393/Glory!
2120015394/Could use a bite.
2120015395/Wrong, witcher.
2120015396/Be smart. I'm watching.
2120015397/I serve King Radovid!
2120015398/I'm a loyal servant of Redania!
2120015399/Congratulations on the Professor. Pompous twit tried to blackmail me once. Thanks for the good news.
2120015400/What brings you here?
2120015401/Geralt?
2120015402/Total chaos. But thanks to my agents, Foltest returned and is trying to restore order.
2120015403/I wish you luck.
2120015404/Not now.
2120015405/Greetings, Geralt.
2120015406/Good. Finish the bastards.
2120015407/Farewell.
2120015408/We have several things to discuss.
2120015409/Relax, Foltest, my children will rule this land. I don't intend to destroy it.
2120015410/So be it. My armies will embark on a mission of fraternal assistance as soon as we sign the preliminary treaty. We shall figure out those towns later...
2120015411/Come on, Foltest, the kingdom's worth a lot more than that.
2120015412/We said five hamlets!
2120015413/Relax, we'll pay you as much as you want.
2120015414/My armies will embark on a mission of fraternal assistance...
2120015415/Silence, Geralt, or I'll have your head!
2120015416/Ha! Ha! Ha!
2120015417/One year...
2120015418/Throw in one more concession and I'll agree.
2120015419/Calm yourself, Foltest. You must raise taxes, there is simply no other way.
2120015420/You must find funds somehow. I'll gladly listen if you have any better ideas.
2120015421/Long live Foltest!
2120015422/Don't tangle with us.
2120015423/Temeria will be victorious.
2120015424/Run!
2120015425/Charge!
2120015426/Attack! Fight!
2120015427/I want to live!
2120015428/Honor!
2120015429/Halt!
2120015430/Yeees...
2120015431/Follow me! Courage!
2120015432/Semper Fi!
2120015433/Onward! Into the foray!
2120015434/I know not your intention.
2120015435/Help me!
2120015436/What?
2120015437/Temeria is a mess.
2120015438/I shall assemble a great hunt when I return.
2120015439/Murderer!
2120015440/Begone!
2120015441/Master Geralt.
2120015442/Finally someone interesting.
2120015443/Basta. I've had enough.
2120015444/My father is a soldier!
2120015445/When monsters attack, my father will defend me!
2120015446/Don't say that!
2120015447/Enough formalities. What do you want?
2120015448/Can...you...hear?
2120015449/Why would I help you?!
2120015450/So you're hip deep in manure. Why contact me?
2120015451/You must think me mad.
2120015452/You're in over your heads. All your experiments, fisstech deals... I won't help you.
2120015453/I greet you.
2120015454/See you, witcher.
2120015455/I can, but I won't. Suffice to say that Salamandra's actions don't suit me right now, which makes us allies. Good luck, witcher, and say hello to Adda! Hahaha!
2120015456/Bravo, an impressive slaughter. Here I feared those idiots would bore me with incessant pleas, but they proved entertaining after all...
2120015457/Political leverage, witcher.
2120015458/Radovid. I don't like being interrupted...
2120015459/Hahaha! Nobody's said that to me in a long time. I like you, you go straight for the jugular. I'll tell you who I am, but not out of fear. I share nothing in common with the Salamandra, absolutely nothing. I once thought to use them as a tool, but I changed my mind.
2120015460/Witcher?
2120015461/Hello again, witcher!
2120015462/No magic mirror between us this time. I'm pleased you found my sanctuary. Triss Merigold lent a hand, am I right?
2120015463/Not personally, but I know Philippa Eilhart and that's like knowing all sorceresses. I wished to speak with you, witcher...
2120015464/Good luck, witcher.
2120015465/Haha! When did you figure it out?
2120015466/If ever in Redania, visit the royal court. Farewell.
2120015467/You're an expert on monsters, you broke her striga spell...
2120015468/Nothing attracts sons-of-bitches like power...
2120015469/Mark my words...
2120015470/Hmm, can she bear children?
2120015471/Though in her favor, Triss once betrayed her "girlfriends."
2120015472/She has bribed, dazzled, or bullied half of Redania's elite. She also belongs to the Lodge of Sorceresses, as does your Triss.
2120015473/Sadly, I'm surrounded by corrupt traitors, overly ambitious sorceresses, and frustrated chaplains of the Eternal Fire...
2120015474/Don't disregard sorceresses... Beautiful, wise, helpful... at least so they present themselves. Some day, I'll put them in their place...
2120015475/I had hoped to persuade her to marry the king of Redania, which would benefit both kingdoms. With Foltest's help, our king could finally rid himself of all the parasites surrounding him. In turn, Redania could support Temeria in its fight against the Scoia'tael. I need not mention the benefits of increased trade.
2120015476/The kingdoms united could resist the expanding powers of the knightly orders and the guilds. Additionally...
2120015477/Hahaha! Well done.
2120015478/It's just as Thaler said. Foltest didn't sign these. I'd recognize his signature.
2120015479/One of Redania's most prominent citizens.
2120015480/Healthy, human children?
2120015481/Good question, but one with no simple answer.
2120015482/No. Each sorceress believes she's to decide the fate of the world. Sometimes, they do...
2120015483/Splendid! Our agent will await you at midnight in the militia's storehouse.
2120015484/No. I feel I should inform him of this...
2120015485/They bear the royal seal, but some suspect fraud.
2120015486/As it turns out, some edict scrolls lie in the militia's storage. Effectively unguarded, because who would steal edicts...
2120015487/Well, we both stand to gain. I'll pay in gold.
2120015488/Good... let's look...
2120015489/Certainly. I'd be a fool not to know Temeria's chief of intelligence.
2120015490/Familiar with these strange edicts in Vizima?
2120015491/Thank you. Keep this conversation confidential. And please don't meddle in Redania's dynastic intentions.
2120015492/And you, witcher, what do you think of Foltest's daughter?
2120015493/I was raised at the Redanian royal court. My father was murdered during the war with Nilfgaard. Ever since I lost interest in toys, I've strived to regain my heritage, find my father's murderers, and introduce order to my lands.
2120015494/Curse you!
2120015495/The Lionhead Spider curse you!
2120015496/Go away and come back with wine!
2120015497/Greetings.
2120015498/Who do I see?
2120015499/Go plow youself, pervert!
2120015500/In a minute, dear, I need to fill another order.
2120015501/Greetings, handsome. You look a tinge fatigued... Wait! Didn't you rescue that child at the gate?
2120015502/By chance? Really. If only the local peasants chanced to do good once in a while... Ugh, no matter.
2120015503/What can I get you?
2120015504/I'll bring it in a minute. You're quite a talker.
2120015505/Ah, but you know how to compliment a woman, handsome.
2120015506/Not likely. I'm a decent girl, I'm at work now.
2120015507/You sure know how to compliment a woman, sir.
2120015508/How dare you?! What a boor!
2120015509/There you go, handsome.
2120015510/Wine, I said. Beauclair White would be best. My grandmother's neighbor is sure to have some.
2120015511/Who do you think I am? You forgot the wine? You have no respect for me. I really am frightened of the ghosts within!
2120015512/Finally. I feared you'd never arrive. This place makes my flesh crawl... Did you bring the wine as I asked?
2120015513/Perhaps I shouldn't... What if my new frock gets dirty?
2120015514/Oh, thank you, I feel much braver now.
2120015515/Of course. Whatever you like.
2120015516/Just remember... this must be our little secret.
2120015517/None of your business, tramp!
2120015518/Let's see just how tough you are!
2120015519/Try being rough, I dare you!
2120015520/Over my dead body!
2120015521/Are you walking me home or not?
2120015522/Good things come to those who hustle... heehee.
2120015523/Quickly, I don't have all night.
2120015524/Piss off. I'll be fine on my own.
2120015525/Is that you? Witcher, help!
2120015526/My grandmother told me never to talk to strangers.
2120015527/See you soon.
2120015528/Walking me home or not?
2120015529/They came after us... like something was controlling them...
2120015530/We're here. Thank you, how can I repay you?
2120015531/Everything, except if we met to pray together. But listen, I know this one place... The old mill.
2120015532/Exactly! But people say it's haunted. I wouldn't want the miller's ghost disturbing us.
2120015533/Settled then. I'll see you tomorrow after sunset. Bring wine and I'll bring food.
2120015534/I don't know... I live with my grandma and I'd rather not shock her.
2120015535/It's those dogs... those hellhounds...
2120015536/Will you help me? I fear the dogs and thugs, but I need to get home.
2120015537/Those who hustle always get rewarded... Hee hee.
2120015538/Don't have the balls to fight a witcher, Butch?
2120015539/Hurry, I don't have all night.
2120015540/Fall back!
2120015541/I detest crooks like you.
2120015542/It's elementary.
2120015543/Fight!
2120015544/You're in deep shit.
2120015545/Stop! Not a step closer!
2120015546/Attack!
2120015547/That makes no sense...
2120015548/Let's go!
2120015549/Hm, mere deduction.
2120015550/Die!
2120015551/You're wasting my valuable time, witcher.
2120015552/You'll soon learn the truth. Excited?
2120015553/You'll soon learn the truth.
2120015554/He's here already.
2120015555/So you say!
2120015556/He suspected nothing until he found the dog dead, shot in the muzzle with a heavy crossbow. He wasn't even sure it was his dog... but then he found his wife, pinned to the kitchen door with a spear.
2120015557/Talk to Vincent Meis, captain of the city guards, and question the witness.
2120015558/Well, well, well. What do we have here?
2120015559/I'm all ears, White Wolf.
2120015560/All the better. There'll be fewer guards there.
2120015561/Surprising. Sure he didn't pull the wool over your eyes?
2120015562/I'll risk trusting you... Let me tell you a story.
2120015563/Azar Javed, a Zerrikanian sorcerer, leads Salamandra. He's more dangerous than a pit of kikimores, but unfortunately, out of my reach. With his contacts and resources, he's got almost free reign in the city.
2120015564/He searched the house in vain for his son. The culprits hadn't left a trace.
2120015565/Heh... His information could be priceless. Good luck.
2120015566/A happy couple once lived in Vizima. Ordinary as fish in a pond, with a ten-year-old boy. One day, the father returned home and was puzzled not to be greeted by his son, his dog, or the smell of dinner on the stove.
2120015567/What about our other leads?
2120015568/All right, I'll cross him off our list of suspects... for now.
2120015569/A warrior like no other, your legend precedes you. How can I help?
2120015570/Ask around about Vincent and Salamandra. Talk to anyone you can link to our suspect.
2120015571/I expected as much. Azar must have Vincent in the palm of his hand.
2120015572/He may be one of the leaders, though in this town the guards capture pawns while the big fish swim free. We'll know for certain once you question him.
2120015573/Back to reality. This is what I've managed to learn...
2120015574/The captain of the guard, who dropped that investigation, disappears nights. Maybe you can squeeze some information out of him.
2120015575/Except, six months later, a monster's corpse turned up in a trash heap. Eyes like festering wounds. Pale, rough skin. Unnaturally muscular body. Everyone had forgotten the murder and disappearance. Almost everyone...
2120015576/I've heard it... Why are you looking for Javed?
2120015577/We're not exactly friends. The captain sees me as competition. He won't talk to me.
2120015578/I suspect Salamandra has built a large scale operation, with gold simply greasing the wheels of their political ambitions. They're conducting genetic experiments, dangerous ones. Regular thugs wouldn't have the knowledge or means...
2120015579/Once you have a clear picture, confront him.
2120015580/In the meantime, follow through on all the other leads, no matter how insignificant they might seem.
2120015581/You could "talk" to them at night. No witnesses...
2120015582/I saw him in the stables with two young pages. You wouldn't believe...
2120015583/As a professional, you understand information has its price...
2120015584/Find a promising lead, ask the suspect about it. His reaction will speak volumes.
2120015585/Just so happens I know a thing or two. Before I go on, I wouldn't mind knowing what your interest in the case is.
2120015586/I've been working on that case for a while.
2120015587/That, witcher, is what investigations are about. Getting the facts.
2120015588/We might have one more lead. The city guards detained someone who could provide information.
2120015589/Yes. Find a way to question that prisoner. In the meantime, learn what you can from the guards.
2120015590/We need proof, something to present to someone higher up. For now, you'd best stay away from Meis.
2120015591/What about our other leads? We need to follow them -- cautiously.
2120015592/A real joker, huh? No chance.
2120015593/Join the club. It'll cost you 100 orens.
2120015594/The father has devoted his life to tracking down the murderers.
2120015595/See, the missing boy had one characteristic feature: a sixth toe. Only the parents knew about it, always had trouble finding shoes for the kid. And the dead monster had an identical sixth toe.
2120015596/To make a long story short, Vincent Meis had to close the case. No witnesses, no evidence.
2120015597/Usually I charge for information, but I'll give you this bit for free...
2120015598/He's hiding something, that's clear. But I'll look into that later.
2120015599/Good question. I used to work for the lawyers Codringher and Fen. Satisfied?
2120015600/He spill anything?
2120015601/Patience, this is just like fishing.
2120015602/Then gain Kalkstein's trust. Do him a favor, learn something that interests him. You could get him to hire you...
2120015603/And talk to Ramsmeat. But don't overdo it -- there's one with a short temper.
2120015604/Lousy work in a town full of dirt and conspiracies. I spend most of my time spying on nobles and rich burghers who cheat on their wives. You can't imagine what people are capable of...
2120015605/I recently followed Morden, commander of Foltest's palace guards. Heard of him?
2120015606/You sure? Strange... Ramsmeat wants Salamandra gone, unless something I don't know about has occurred...
2120015607/That might be true, but we need to check all our leads. Let's get to work. I'll ask around town, talk to my contacts. You keep an eye on Kalkstein, gain his trust, get to know his plans and secrets.
2120015608/Any conclusions?
2120015609/Something to check. Did you get anything out of the prisoner?
2120015610/Makes sense. Kalkstein's known to be a talented alchemist. He could be helping Javed with his experiments...
2120015611/Wait here a while. Make them nervous.
2120015612/Just one thing... I think you're being followed.
2120015613/Salamandra... I was a step away from solving the mystery. One small step.
2120015614/Thanks, Geralt, you saved my life. Bastards snuck in here. Somehow they found out I'm after them!
2120015615/Not likely! They're following me, day and night. I've got to find a way to lose them.
2120015616/I'll set a false trail. You question the new suspects.
2120015617/Here, take these notes. They list all the key leads.
2120015618/They're on my heels, so I've got to disappear. I'll draw them away while you pursue the investigation. I'll find you, White Wolf!
2120015619/Not now! I'm in danger.
2120015620/Look closely at the liver for any signs of alchemy.
2120015621/Welcome! You won't believe what happened.
2120015622/Yes?
2120015623/The costs are what they are... Take it or leave it.
2120015624/Down to business. They transferred the prisoner after the attack.
2120015625/I need to think. Come back later.
2120015626/And I know how to handle this case. Go do something useful. Tend to that autopsy
2120015627/So it went smoothly.
2120015628/We can't move forward without it.
2120015629/How's that?
2120015630/Come back later. I need to analyze this information.
2120015631/Well, he wasn't in great shape, so I guess it's no surprise. But I have a feeling...
2120015632/Especially since we won't get anything else out of him. He died last night.
2120015633/Not so fast. Remember, I have expenses.
2120015634/How do you know?
2120015635/200 orens.
2120015636/I'm not the prophet Lebioda. I can't live on roots and berries. Neither can my informers. I guarantee you these are the bare necessities.
2120015637/Exactly. Shani's a good friend of yours, right? Ask her to do an autopsy. Once we know the cause of death...
2120015638/That's my job.
2120015639/I see you did your homework...
2120015640/None? None at all?
2120015641/He's usually at the Hairy Bear Tavern or at his own dive nearby. Two thugs with hammers watch the door.
2120015642/So, poison after all... But how can you be sure it was Kalkstein?
2120015643/How do you know?
2120015644/I need to analyze this information. Come back tomorrow.
2120015645/I'm good at what I do. I don't go around telling you how to hunt monsters, do I?
2120015646/Witcher...don't get me wrong, but this is hardly my first case. I'm in my element, been wading in this bog for years.
2120015647/And?
2120015648/Examine the internal organs. Poison is in fashion, especially in marital disputes, and anyone can prepare deadly decoctions from ordinary herbs.
2120015649/I'm not proud of it, but I can control myself. It's not a habit.
2120015650/So what's your plan?
2120015651/Of course I am. You are paying me, after all. Besides, we're friends now...
2120015652/Come on, Geralt. I'm the first to admit I'm no saint, but I don't get into nasty stuff.
2120015653/What else?
2120015654/An investment, Geralt. My office needs to look good, convey professionalism.
2120015655/I'm getting on in years. Old age is no picnic. We can't all have mutated bodies... I have to keep warm.
2120015656/All right... Ready?
2120015657/Yes! You have me!
2120015658/You killed Ramsmeat?
2120015659/And that is?
2120015660/Hahaha! You mistake stars reflected in a pond for the night sky. As a master mage, I barely need to fight. It'll be a massacre.
2120015661/Geralt, isn't that a stretch?
2120015662/Let's drop this masquerade and get back to work.
2120015663/The possibilities are many. That's why my plan is pure genius.
2120015664/Clever, witcher, but hardly clever enough. I foresaw this. My men await my signal. You won't live to see sunrise.
2120015665/He's the only one to have any knowledge of magic. I don't think he's strictly a theoretician, either. Plus, all those who worked with him mysteriously disappeared... Definitely my number one suspect.
2120015666/Spit it out, Geralt.
2120015667/Truly? I don't think so. Quite the opposite. I'm in control.
2120015668/If I were Azar, I'd crush you like a worm...
2120015669/Witcher's vision, I forgot. But we're not all witchers. A normal person would think, "What a worldly fellow, he must have worked all over." And that's the idea.
2120015670/He's wealthy, has resources, and he's clearly involved in some scheme. I know his sort -- they buy whoever they want. Courtiers, guards, royal clerks - all in their pockets. Yes, I guess Leuvaarden could be the Salamandra boss.
2120015671/That confirms Ramsmeat and his men were just a strike force. Now we know the evidence points to Kalkstein.
2120015672/I saw him in town some time ago, busy bashing perverts.
2120015673/He's my chief suspect, too. It was a gut feeling, though without proof I didn't mention him. But since you suspect him, there must be something to it.
2120015674/What don't you understand? Everyone knows the guard commander hates anyone he can call deviant.
2120015675/Why do I have to be Javed?
2120015676/I'm good at what I do. I don't go around telling you how to hunt monsters, do I?
2120015677/I have. We need to lure him into a trap. The swamp tower interests him - we can use it as bait. So, I'll wait for you there.
2120015678/A mysterious fellow, he's liable to have his dirty secrets...
2120015679/Three. Go after him a bit, but I'd say the alchemist and Ramsmeat are more important.
2120015680/I'll set my contacts on him, check him out good and thorough. He's my number two. You could press him a bit, he may spill some information. He's rumored to be edgy, so he could snap...
2120015681/And I know how to handle this case.
2120015682/Witcher...don't get me wrong, but this is hardly my first case. I'm in my element, been wading in this bog for years.
2120015683/Good. He leads Salamandra's armed force. You have to kill him.
2120015684/Not now.
2120015685/Here at last!
2120015686/Listen, I've got it all figured out. Kalkstein and Ramsmeat were associates. I have irrefutable evidence.
2120015687/We set a trap, though it might be dangerous. Gather your equipment and come back later.
2120015688/Great work, all the pieces fit. Now we need to get the bastard somehow. I can't fight a mage. Any ideas?
2120015689/That would put him with the Scoia'tael... but who knows. Check him out. I'll ask around, too. But don't forget the other suspects, especially the alchemist and Ramsmeat.
2120015690/Approach him carefully. He may be more dangerous than he looks...
2120015691/Must be my warning amulets. Salamandra's men could attack at any moment.
2120015692/You compare me to a few insignificant bandits?
2120015693/I'll trounce you like the worm you are. You don't stand a chance against me.
2120015694/True, as a master mage I use illusions.
2120015695/Surrender? Stop kidding around, Geralt. This isn't funny.
2120015696/In this town only the fish in the lake don't take bait, and that's just because they're floating belly up. Without proof, he's a waste of our time. Let's focus on Kalkstein and Ramsmeat.
2120015697/Vivaldi could be the organization's sponsor, but even that seems unlikely. I've never seen a nonhuman Salamander. I just can't picture a dwarf commanding them.
2120015698/It'd be good to know what he's hiding, but Ramsmeat and Kalkstein remain my chief suspects.
2120015699/Occasional. I started while investigating a certain baron. Had to be on my feet day and night.
2120015700/Everyone should know what's going on in the world. It also improves my image. Say you were a client. What would you think when you saw that map?
2120015701/By no means. Customers and how they see you matter. Once we wrap up this case, I plan to expand my business.
2120015702/Speak freely, Geralt. You can trust me.
2120015703/No reason to be shy. Tell me.
2120015704/And that is?
2120015705/Kill the witcher!
2120015706/Hm, let's think... He certainly has resources, both financial and human. He also has motive - his lust for power. He's a thoroughbred outlaw, used to operating in the underworld. How magic plays into it, I'm not sure. But we might've overlooked something.
2120015707/Unlikely. Even if he was involved in getting the Professor freed, that just makes him a crooked cop.
2120015708/Excellent! You broke the organization's spine.
2120015709/Yes?
2120015710/Of course... what?
2120015711/You need to squeeze him for information, get it out of him - up to you how you do it.
2120015712/Right! When do we go?
2120015713/Oh, that? Ramsmeat's revenge. I investigated one of his underlings. Now they want to discredit me. Don't worry about that.
2120015714/I've been working late, feeling a bit ill...
2120015715/A master mage made these amulets. They're not Saint Lebioda's tail bones or other crap from the market square.
2120015716/We'll rip the proof from Kalkstein's dead hands. He's Azar Javed's chief aide. He may even be Javed himself.
2120015717/That's where I come in. This stone is the key to the tower... or part of the key. You make sure you get Kalkstein interested, like we agreed.
2120015718/Geralt, we're nearing our investigation's end. The solution is within reach.
2120015719/We need to secure what's hidden in the tower, all the books and scrolls - bait for our target.
2120015720/Do you really want to die, witcher?
2120015721/Aren't you eager to learn the truth?
2120015722/Yes, hurry. We can't let Kalkstein get ahead of us. I hope that murderer swallowed the bait.
2120015723/A client!
2120015724/Run for your lives!
2120015725/At them! Spare none!
2120015726/You'll regret that, bitch.
2120015727/Defend yourself, asswipe.
2120015728/Spare me!
2120015729/Get out of my sight!
2120015730/Follow me! Look lively!
2120015731/Attack!
2120015732/Hm.
2120015733/Now you die.
2120015734/No.
2120015735/Save yourselves! Run!
2120015736/You'll regret this!
2120015737/Spare me!
2120015738/Out! You're gone!
2120015739/Why are you here, witcher?
2120015740/Follow me! Look lively!
2120015741/Fuck, don't know you, don't like you.
2120015742/Bid farewell to the world.
2120015743/Attack!
2120015744/They're yours, grab them!
2120015745/Now you die.
2120015746/A jester, huh?
2120015747/I piss on your juvenile scorn. What do you want?
2120015748/I thought he would lead me to Salamandra's leader.
2120015749/Great. My boys are itchin' to fuck someone over...
2120015750/He's driven by instinct, thinks with that Zerrikanian cock of his. And he's got some strange fetishes... likes fire. My girls are scared shitless, and they don't scare that easily.
2120015751/You're all right, Wolf.
2120015752/Not now.
2120015753/You haven't the faintest idea who you're talking to, freak. One word and before you count to three you'll be facing a dozen hardened assassins.
2120015754/Ha ha ha! I'm the king of the underworld, Wolf. Whores, thieves, murderers - they all answer to me. Come see me when you need work.
2120015755/Anything else?
2120015756/Make sure you remember that. I mean... image is everything, right?
2120015757/Enough! Boys, kill him!
2120015758/Take a good look... Do I seem like a whore to you?
2120015759/They're like me - we don't like Salamandra.
2120015760/What's it to you?
2120015761/You sure?
2120015762/I'm listening.
2120015763/And I thought Salamandra sent you...
2120015764/They'd really like me out of the saddle. They tried to poison me and sent several masked assholes out to assassinate me. But that's all too little for uncle Ramsmeat. I thought you were their next attempt.
2120015765/We found them. Your friend was in trouble, scheming with Salamandra.
2120015766/Well, the cub growls, but does it bite? I could use someone for wet work.
2120015767/Contempt, wolf cub, is the privilege of the prudent. In all others it's a sign of youth and ignorance.
2120015768/No one talks to me like that in my own house! Get out!
2120015769/What?
2120015770/I have a rule. Before I slit someone's throat I give them some advice: never threaten me.
2120015771/You're either very brave or very foolish to accuse me.
2120015772/Quickly.
2120015773/Relax, a rhetorical question. I know how you handled the Provost's and the Michelet Brothers' crew. I'll answer your questions... as a token of good will.
2120015774/I've seen a lot. Have a problem with that?
2120015775/You should've asked my men why they get nervous! Now shove off!
2120015776/You cracked?! I sent them there to bring back one of ours!
2120015777/I don't give a rat's arse!
2120015778/Unfortunately, he ran afoul of Salamandra, then the guards captured him. Those I sent to help, you cut up.
2120015779/Thanks a lot, but you'll allow me not to fall at your feet... If you do happen to find Javed, I'll be glad to hear about it.
2120015780/Javed wants to take over my business. He decided to start with the girls. Know why? Though he left Zerrikania long ago and trained to be a mage, deep inside he's remained a fucked up wild man. Now you get it?
2120015781/And if you find any of his underlings, I wouldn't mind having a chat with them, too.
2120015782/Old whores have wings. Beat it, witcher!
2120015783/Ask the people in the swamp. That's where we found those trinkets.
2120015784/What do you want, Wolf?
2120015785/You're lucky I'm having a good day. I won't kill you. And now beat it before I have them carry you out...
2120015786/What you want, freak?
2120015787/Go plow your mama!
2120015788/So why are you trying to fuck me?
2120015789/He disappeared in the swamp. Kalkstein hired one of my boys to find him, then he disappeared. That's all. Now get lost.
2120015790/Again, what's it to you?
2120015791/Good. So you gain the element of surprise, but you'll still have to face this powerful sorcerer alone.
2120015792/They expected Salamandra would attack and might've mistaken you for them...
2120015793/You choose your friends poorly. Berengar schemed with Salamandra and that's why we had our eye on him. As they say, keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
2120015794/Go on.
2120015795/No shit.
2120015796/Yeah, so what?
2120015797/Pity. Life's a bitch, then you die. Now, if you'll shove off, I've got some deals to tend to.
2120015798/Shame. A misunderstanding, then. I forgive you for killing my crew.
2120015799/What did my man say?
2120015800/No problem.
2120015801/You annoy me.
2120015802/Anything else?
2120015803/Spit it out.
2120015804/Good work, Wolf.
2120015805/Should've run when you had the chance!
2120015806/Hm, maybe not...
2120015807/Don't hurt me!
2120015808/Oh shit, run!
2120015809/You'll be sorry!
2120015810/What do you want, twerp?
2120015811/Hm.
2120015812/Everyone follow me! I said everyone!
2120015813/I'll slay you like a dog!
2120015814/Draw your weapons! Attack!
2120015815/Attack!
2120015816/My nose itches.
2120015817/Stop right there!
2120015818/Try your luck.
2120015819/Go on, make my day.
2120015820/Any closer and you die!
2120015821/Are you stupid?
2120015822/We'll show you, stubby!
2120015823/Nonhuman scum!
2120015824/Off with the midget's beard!
2120015825/Bloody dwarf!
2120015826/Dance for us, you dwarven bitch!
2120015827/Send 'em to the reservation!
2120015828/Nonhumans begone!
2120015829/Hands off human women, dwarf!
2120015830/I'll gouge out those bug-eyes!
2120015831/Love nonhumans, do you?
2120015832/We're shaving off his beard. What's it to you?
2120015833/Oo, a live one. Get him, lads! Kill the deviant!
2120015834/Something haunts the old mill again.
2120015835/They're never around when you need them... It'll have to wait... any monster here today will stay until tomorrow...
2120015836/Certainly no sense in sending anyone else...
2120015837/Wait for the rest!
2120015838/Wrong neighborhood. Nonhumans live elsewhere!
2120015839/Another witcher? Hope you disappear like the last one.
2120015840/Shove off, twit.
2120015841/Looking for adventure?
2120015842/Just warning you. Do as Berengar did and you'll get what you deserve.
2120015843/I'll say it again: Haren should keep a closer eye on them.
2120015844/Something missing again?
2120015845/Where would he get the coin to pay us then, dimwit?
2120015846/Of course.
2120015847/Aye.
2120015848/Oh, the vixens.
2120015849/I get your gear if you drown.
2120015850/Are you daft? Drunk as y'are, the drowners'll take you for liquor and nab you.
2120015851/That sword on your back could double as an oar.
2120015852/I'm gonna retch.
2120015853/I detest the Scoia'tael.
2120015854/Just stay out of my way.
2120015855/Keep that sword to yourself.
2120015856/Shove off.
2120015857/Gold, come to Pappy.
2120015858/What glimmers so in these ruins?
2120015859/That stench!
2120015860/Back to looting the dead for me...
2120015861/Die, filthy nonhumans.
2120015862/Nothing but rubbish.
2120015863/Damn these humans ire me.
2120015864/Stop!
2120015865/Dammit...
2120015866/Should I mug someone...?
2120015867/That your mother-in-law, ha ha?
2120015868/Help!
2120015869/Trying to piss me off?
2120015870/Damn, what a freak!
2120015871/Weather's gone sour.
2120015872/It's raining again.
2120015873/I detest rain.
2120015874/Ha, never seen anything stranger than that freak.
2120015875/The plague.
2120015876/My balls itch.
2120015877/Smash the sons-of-bitches!
2120015878/Desist!
2120015879/Flee! Run for your life!
2120015880/You're dead already!
2120015881/Turn back before more blood is spilt.
2120015882/Yaaa...
2120015883/Follow me! Move!
2120015884/Tough is what tough does.
2120015885/Hit the son-of-a-bitch!
2120015886/Your turn to die!
2120015887/Are you stupid?
2120015888/Anyone seeking to cross?
2120015889/You are mistaken, kind Sir.
2120015890/Perish!
2120015891/Spare me!
2120015892/Who wishes to cross?
2120015893/The waters seem unsettled...
2120015894/A new customer? Come aboard.
2120015895/Good sir, do you need a boat?
2120015896/They tried to draft me into the army. Luckily, King Foltest has returned. He'll put those nonhumans back on their leashes.
2120015897/Witcher...
2120015898/Yes, all yours in return for the ring. This key will open the gate in the sewers.
2120015899/I hid family valuables just before the war, and now...
2120015900/Don't jump to conclusions. Undead linger near my belongings. All I want is the return of my ring.
2120015901/Enter the sewers and look for a gate. Beyond is the crypt where I hid the chest.
2120015902/You look able with a sword!
2120015903/Keep it all, as long as you return the family ring to me.
2120015904/With that ring I'll come into my inheritance.
2120015905/I'll wait here every morning.
2120015906/I know you well enough -- I saw your sort during the war, death marching alongside them.
2120015907/As agreed. My foolish comrades died while I survived.
2120015908/None of your concern... Bye.
2120015909/I'm hard up!
2120015910/Got any?
2120015911/Shh! Not here!
2120015912/You might find someone at the Hairy Bear.
2120015913/There's an idea! Which one...?
2120015914/Got a coin for a brew?
2120015915/Snatch a beggar's bowl!
2120015916/Any time...
2120015917/Connections are everything.
2120015918/Bribing guards empties my purse!
2120015919/I say I deal with Jethro - they leave me alone.
2120015920/If he wants snow from me, he should earn it.
2120015921/What is the world coming to? Women calling the shots!
2120015922/Eyeing those wenches on the corner?
2120015923/If I only had the coin... You know they raised their prices again?
2120015924/C'est la vie. The chief looks after 'em, so we best suffer 'em.
2120015925/What bait you using?
2120015926/Clever, truly laughable.
2120015927/Anything biting?
2120015928/And the Squirrels grow troublesome.
2120015929/Not many boats lately.
2120015930/My bets ride on Boxer today. He's one strong son of a bitch.
2120015931/Boxer turned his last foe's nose into a bloody pulp.
2120015932/What a champion!
2120015933/Shh, he'll hear. You know how hard he hits?
2120015934/I'll buy some cheap powder, find customers, grow wealthy.
2120015935/Mugging?
2120015936/Beat a man, take whatever you can sell. Simple.
2120015937/As if! Nothing like mugging.
2120015938/Lemme have a sniff.
2120015939/Pff..! With this, I talk so smooth all the wenches draw near.
2120015940/Those that don't, get smacked, heh heh.
2120015941/Don't overdo it.
2120015942/I tell him the papers are valuable...
2120015943/He wants to look again. So I says someone well-read is certain to gauge their value.
2120015944/Hah! That dullard barely knows the alphabet.
2120015945/And he says?
2120015946/Just so! I flattered him so well the fool bought the crap!
2120015947/Greetings. Gonna shake your arse?
2120015948/No coin, no action. I have this stone...
2120015949/Fetch us an ale?
2120015950/You won't put out anymore?!
2120015951/Go on like that and I'll give you a real reason to laugh. Let's see what you have in that pouch.
2120015952/Eeeh.... Yeah, sorry. No hard feelings, grey one. We'll be seeing you.
2120015953/Why're you here, grey one? This is our territory.
2120015954/Shove off!
2120015955/Get on Ramsmeat's bad side and you'll disappear... just like Berengar.
2120015956/Looking for adventure?
2120015957/You look lost.
2120015958/I ferry people from Vizima to the swamp and back.
2120015959/Time's a-wasting, made up your mind?
2120015960/Transport services at the best prices.
2120015961/Ready to go?
2120015962/I ferry people from Vizima to the swamp and back.
2120015963/Time is money, made up your mind?
2120015964/Transport services at the best prices.
2120015965/Ready to go?
2120015966/Finally!
2120015967/Four hundred orens and give my best to Yaren.
2120015968/Don't dawdle.
2120015969/What do you want?
2120015970/Witcher, go and see Yaren Bolt, the lead woodcutter. He ought to have a job for you. He lives in the southern end of the swamp.
2120015971/This is Yaren's doing! I'll show that thieving nonhuman!
2120015972/Hiccup!
2120015973/Hic... Join us?
2120015974/Didya know they send our local booze to somewhere called Export?
2120015975/Yes, drinking's always an option... and you might even win something.
2120015976/I'm not just anyone. I'm Yamo Ryeboozer. That's Temerian rye vodka on the table.
2120015977/You've already won. Now we drink for pleasure.
2120015978/Sometimes we see who stays upright longest... for a prize...
2120015979/Damned if I know where Export is, but it must be a wealthy land. Shiploads of bottles and jugs sailing into the sunset...
2120015980/You're a tough one.
2120015981/Ha! The reward - a recipe for a miraculous hangover cure.
2120015982/I'll neeever drink with you!
2120015983/A pleasure doing business with you! Here's your letter.
2120015984/I said, piss off!
2120015985/You know where to come.
2120015986/Who are you?
2120015987/What the fuck does "no matter" mean?!
2120015988/What do you want?
2120015989/This is way over your head. You're making a big mistake.
2120015990/Eat me. I'm outta here.
2120015991/Who said I sell anything?
2120015992/That old shroom sports a loose tongue. All right, how much do you want?
2120015993/Oo, I don't have that much, but 1500 orens will get you a recommendation to people who do. It's up to you.
2120015994/It'll cost you 1500 orens.
2120015995/Piss off! Stop following me!
2120015996/You're one stubborn son-of-a-whore! I'll make you regret this!
2120015997/Don't hit me, I'm working! This isn't easy, you know.
2120015998/Now some thinner... almost ready.
2120015999/I know, I know, we're behind.
2120016000/You don't even look like you're worth robbing.
2120016001/Damnable thief's life. I know I'll hang one day...
2120016002/Nice knife.
2120016003/Fire, fire and flames everywhere!
2120016004/The flame's destiny is to be destined... No, how did that go... Aah, my head...
2120016005/White frost, a blizzard and death. Aaah, Eternal Fire protect us.
2120016006/Where is the little girl?
2120016007/Piddle, diddle! Destiny's sword has two ends. You are one. The other is...?
2120016008/The gods will punish you!
2120016009/I expected you'd come.
2120016010/Burn in Eternal Fire!
2120016011/Take it away!
2120016012/Why are you here?
2120016013/Villainous witch! Godless woman! Confess! Gaze upon her, friends, she is drunk on the devil's herb. The witchery is written on her face!
2120016014/NOT_USED
2120016015/Since the beginning of time, woman has been the nest of all evil! The Tool of Chaos, party to the conspiracy against the world and the human race! Woman is ruled solely by corporal lust! To satisfy her insatiable hunger and unnatural desires, she gladly serves demons!
2120016016/Friends, they wish to scare us. Fear not. They're helpless as long as we stand together...
2120016017/There she is! Burn the foul witch!
2120016018/Uhhhhh.
2120016019/NOT_USED
2120016020/Begone, witcher, and leave the witch or we'll burn you, too...
2120016021/Nervous gaze, the face of a killer. He elicited no more trust than you do.
2120016022/Do not sneer at Salamandra. The whole village fears them for a reason. You must convince us all.
2120016023/Everyone knows and respects them. Odo is rich; Haren a merchant; and Mikul a city guard. Gain their trust and you'll win the trust of the village.
2120016024/Rather dig a ditch?
2120016025/Another witcher came here before you. He, too, swaggered with audacity. And yet, do you see him? Not likely -- he fled!
2120016026/I must admit I'm impressed. You may yet defeat Salamandra.
2120016027/Impossible!
2120016028/You, a stranger, a drifter? Have you lost your mind?
2120016029/Go to the inn, where a group in Salamandra's service has taken over. They hide in the old house. Olaf will have a key. And witcher...
2120016030/Our community is poor. Perhaps 200?
2120016031/Very well, but the Eternal Fire must appear at night in all five chapels.
2120016032/Cease defiling this temple with your presence!
2120016033/Vexing them may shorten your life.
2120016034/There's nothing to speak of!
2120016035/Ah, yes, your payment... The curse must be stronger than I thought. Doubtless caused by that witch, Abigail, an evil woman!
2120016036/That's not wise.
2120016037/Not your business!
2120016038/What ways?
2120016039/The Eternal Fire, blasphemer! You can be sure it will scare off beasts, for it has been said that "...though his soul be in darkness and his visage be a horror, do not judge him hastily, for he will carry the flame of hope into the night..." And also: "...you shall only be safe in the glow of the Eternal Fire..."
2120016040/Begone, devil's breed!
2120016041/We must know from whence the Beast came. Learn the truth.
2120016042/At night, light a candle in each of the five chapels of the Eternal Fire around our village.
2120016043/I will say nothing until you eliminate the Beast, witcher. That is my condition.
2120016044/Was it summoned by the witch?
2120016045/There may be wisdom in your words. When sheep run astray, the good shepherd must bring them back onto the righteous path. Otherwise they fall prey to wolves. I'll learn all I can to defeat the Beast. I must gather all the villagers... Here is your prize, witcher, 200 orens.
2120016046/Nothing. May the Eternal Fire shine on your soul.
2120016047/You ignited the Eternal Fire. I am grateful.
2120016048/Inside the crypt lies a crumbling sarcophagus.
2120016049/The crypt is a place of honor! You think anyone can demand a burial there?!
2120016050/Serve the Eternal Fire. Carry the Fire to the chapels and I'll give leave to bury your dead in the crypt.
2120016051/As long as you can prove you killed some.
2120016052/Here. May the Eternal Fire illuminate your path.
2120016053/Hurry.
2120016054/Only knights of the Order hold passes. But as chaplain, I have one...
2120016055/It was my duty. Was I to let the witch corrupt him?
2120016056/When I'm gone, the people will need a new spiritual guide...
2120016057/For once in your life, you are right.
2120016058/What do you know? The child may now save his immortal soul. I have led him toward the Eternal Fire. I am burning away his sins and weakness. And it’s none of your concern.
2120016059/Yes, heathen! Only the Eternal Fire can save us from the White Frost!
2120016060/So says the prophecy of Ithlinne, the elven witch!
2120016061/The old world will die, to be born again from a seed that will not sprout, but burst into flames...
2120016062/You mock me, witcher? So tell me, who gave you leave to meddle in the affairs of humans - you, an emotionless mutant. Answer! Who?!
2120016063/Return to your dark life, heathen.
2120016064/Whosoever blasphemes deserves no forgiveness.
2120016065/Wait. They need to believe I sent you. Show them this ring of the Eternal Fire.
2120016066/Another witcher came recently - Berengar. He promised to slay the Beast, but fled when it howled.
2120016067/If you want my trust, bear the Eternal Fire's light to the people and dispel the darkness. You'll find five chapels around the village...
2120016068/Speak, quickly!
2120016069/The beasts still haunt us!
2120016070/For me - destroy the Beast. As for the others - visit Odo, Mikul and Haren. Can you solve their problems, too?
2120016071/They'll kill us because of you.
2120016072/She brought the Beast and all other calamities upon us.
2120016073/Have you made your decision?
2120016074/Abigail should have departed long ago, but stayed to exact revenge for the evil fate that befell her.
2120016075/The witch hides within. Let the Eternal Fire consume her sinful body and we'll be rid of the Beast.
2120016076/What are your charges, Haren?
2120016077/The witch used Odo and Haren. She poisoned Ilsa.
2120016078/She used the devil's magic on these simple people and summoned the Beast.
2120016079/You'll regret this.
2120016080/Get her! Let's end this.
2120016081/Leave now.
2120016082/You're still alive. And the Beast? If you've done well, I'll grant you a pass into the city.
2120016083/Odo! Grab the pitchfork!
2120016084/Helping that whore was your last mistake. Die, bloody mutant!
2120016085/Praise be! We are free of the monster!
2120016086/Here it is. Now go. This letter will see you into Vizima.
2120016087/NOT_USED
2120016088/You have made a wise choice. May the Eternal Fire light your way...
2120016089/NOT_USED
2120016090/I had no choice. Those bandits threatened to kill me!
2120016091/But... but you can't...
2120016092/I was thinking about a certain legend. Ever heard of Raven's armor?
2120016093/A cozy hospital. You know I nearly joined a convent once?
2120016094/Geralt?
2120016095/The Order's armorer is excellent. He has a shop somewhere here in Old Vizima.
2120016096/Tend to your business. We'll meet later.
2120016097/Excuses, excuses.
2120016098/You couldn't have killed more long ears than I.
2120016099/Then some elf carved magic runes on it, further improving it. Getting any ideas?
2120016100/Raven owned a suit of armor created by gnomes, devilish but talented midgets. Praying to their nasty subterranean gods, they forged armor that was light and durable, and didn't hamper movement.
2120016101/You could use something of the sort. Raven employed witchers' fighting techniques. The armor would serve you well. Only a spaulder, rerebrace and steel gauntlet remain of the suit, but the rest could be recreated.
2120016102/It's made for you.
2120016103/Hmm. We'll consider it a tie, then, and finish this contest later.
2120016104/Got me. I've always preferred killing to healing.
2120016105/Siegfried waits with important orders for me. Ready?
2120016106/Stay close to me.
2120016107/Try to keep up. We'll head to the field hospital in the center of Old Vizima. I've already killed 20 Scoia'tael. I wager you can't beat that.
2120016108/Yes. My reward for that elven slut. I told you I'd hunt her down.
2120016109/That's the one. Yaevinn's bitch. I handed her over to the boys, then we hung her. I've never seen anyone fight so fiercely...
2120016110/Greetings, witcher. I knew we would meet again, sooner or later.
2120016111/Don't cheat! The wounded don't count, just the dead!
2120016112/They say Yaevinn's gone wild. Chaos reigns in the elven ranks.
2120016113/As am I. I've got 13 squirrel puffs!
2120016114/I have important matters to discuss with Siegfried.
2120016115/So how did it go, witcher?
2120016116/I need to speak with Siegfried. Take care, Wolf.
2120016117/Come on, bastards! I'll cut your balls off!
2120016118/Try it, elven hag. I am White Rayla. I don't fear you elven sadists.
2120016119/Haha! White Rayla always wins! My gold, please...
2120016120/Indeed, here's your gold.
2120016121/I must speak with Siegfried. Take care, Wolf.
2120016122/Hurry it up.
2120016123/Come... we'll speak where it's safer.
2120016124/Save your breath. Let's go.
2120016125/I could've managed... but thanks.
2120016126/Sure you are. You're incapable of fighting women. I'll prove it. No weapons. I doubt you can take me...
2120016127/I'll prove it. We both know you'd never draw your sword against a woman.
2120016128/The very reason you're called the Butcher of Blaviken. The only woman you ever raised your sword against. Rumor is you plowed her first...
2120016129/And you can have me if you win!
2120016130/Ha! Prove it! If you can...
2120016131/Defend yourself, you pussy!
2120016132/Possibly, but I meant in general. You're very old-fashioned. You'd never hit a woman, or at least you'd hesitate.
2120016133/As a warrior, you're almost ideal...
2120016134/Stop pretending, Geralt. We both know a conscience can be deadly. Hesitate and there'll be a blade in your gut before you know it...
2120016135/Grrrr! I want to see corpses...
2120016136/Ah, that was something! And now some elves for dessert! What a beautiful day!
2120016137/Yes, almost. There may be no man who can defeat you, but a female...
2120016138/You killed Renfri.
2120016139/Stay in formation! Bloody stay in formation!
2120016140/Show them, boys!
2120016141/Attack!
2120016142/Geralt! Smash that damned barricade!
2120016143/Done! The barricade is ours! Victory!
2120016144/Use a Sign! We must break through!
2120016145/Shut up, tin man! This is their last line of defense! Onward!
2120016146/Fuckin' good you're here. This place is going to hell...
2120016147/I shan't let you forget so easily. You killed me and that has its consequences.
2120016148/Lead!
2120016149/You killed me, yet I'm happy to see you.
2120016150/Our ties exceed even death. I will fight at your side. Draw your sword, things are about to get interesting.
2120016151/I know. I didn't choose a soldierly life to die in bed.
2120016152/I have a gift for you, call it a souvenir. The shield that surrounds you will absorb the energy of your foes and grant it to you. Use it well.
2120016153/Kill him!
2120016154/Perish!
2120016155/Fall back!
2120016156/Not a step further!
2120016157/Enough!
2120016158/Die!
2120016159/Kill them!
2120016160/Wolf?
2120016161/Yes?
2120016162/Follow me!
2120016163/Onward!
2120016164/You're confused.
2120016165/Stop, don't!
2120016166/Sound the retreat! Retreat!
2120016167/Die!
2120016168/One step closer and you die.
2120016169/Everyone follow me!
2120016170/I want to see corpses!
2120016171/Your arse is meat.
2120016172/Come on!
2120016173/Get them!
2120016174/You're confused.
2120016175/Geralt of Rivia. I have oft heard of your death...
2120016176/I'm a mercenenary, not a monk.
2120016177/I don't doubt it. Know that Vizima is burning. Nonhumans have turned it into a war zone. Those poor, starving elves are murdering humans by the dozen.
2120016178/Strange words, given your new friend is that murderer Yaevinn. I know you had a hand in the bank robbery. By some coincidence, the Scoia'tael have carried better arms ever since...
2120016179/Watch what you say. You're hardly untouchable. If I discover you working with the Scoia'tael...
2120016180/No, merely helping you to avoid a serious error whose consequences might prove too dire for you to handle.
2120016181/Fall in, dogs!
2120016182/Siegfried vouched for you, so I'll give you a chance. Your intervention at the bank prevented the Scoia'tael from gaining gold to buy arms and provisions. Though weak, I doubt they'll heed you, but you never know... Promise them a fair trial if they lay down their arms.
2120016183/My orders are to halt the unit Toruviel Aep Shihiel commands. And I won't have you getting in my way...
2120016184/You have to draw the line somewhere. During the war, my unit provided cover for retreating civilians. The Scoia'tael were the vanguard of the Nilfgaardian army...
2120016185/I work for anyone willing to pay for nonhuman heads.
2120016186/Pacifist crap.
2120016187/You have my word.
2120016188/Have you seen a unit of elves in the area?
2120016189/They're cowering in the village and they have taken hostages. We'll attack soon...
2120016190/You have my word.
2120016191/White Rayla. What brings you here, witcher?
2120016192/Whatever the case may be, these peasants gave the unit shelter and food. They are guilty of treason.
2120016193/Ha, would you take us on? Very well. Speak to that elven bitch. If they lay down their arms, I guarantee a fair trial - for them and the peasants.
2120016194/Do you? They slaughtered my whole unit. Merciful given what they did to me. Ever been tortured, witcher?
2120016195/Yes?
2120016196/Witcher...
2120016197/I've freed myself from tougher situations...
2120016198/Time will tell. Remember, witcher, history is written by the victors!
2120016199/What of the elves?
2120016200/I don't intend to stay. Toruviel hasn't seen the last of me...
2120016201/You're a traitor.
2120016202/Fucking fanatics, not an ounce of professionalism. They stripped me of my command. When I refused to attack, my adjutant pulled out a letter from Siegfried. Had it all along.
2120016203/Time to abandon this post.
2120016204/Time I was on my way.
2120016205/How did it go?
2120016206/We'll meet again.
2120016207/Tell me what happened.
2120016208/Gerrralt...
2120016209/Gerrralt...
2120016210/You will go no further.
2120016211/I received a new life, my benefactors turned me into the perfect swordswoman. You will go no further.
2120016212/You must die. That is the price I must pay for my new life.
2120016213/Kill him!
2120016214/Choke on this!
2120016215/Retreat!
2120016216/Stop right where you are!
2120016217/Enough!
2120016218/Kill them!
2120016219/I'll feed you your liver!
2120016220/Follow me!
2120016221/Aaaaargh!
2120016222/Yes, sir!
2120016223/Witcher...
2120016224/I came as quickly as I could!
2120016225/What manner of beasts are they?
2120016226/The front gate's of little use, but there's another way in. An old well goes straight down into the cave.
2120016227/Finally! I was worried.
2120016228/Discover anything in the catacombs?
2120016229/I've heard his sheer willpower raised the iron gate of a castle under siege!
2120016230/He's also an excellent swordsman.
2120016231/The Grand Master always keeps his word...
2120016232/And?
2120016233/Soldiers respect him. You'd follow him into the most desperate fights and still believe in victory...
2120016234/The rebellion has yet to be quelled. But the Grand Master is regrouping his armies for a final blow.
2120016235/The King is holding back on disbanding the Order. When we defeat the nonhuman rebels he'll be satisfied with the Grand Master's policies.
2120016236/What? That's impossible! You lie!
2120016237/We'll use a boat at the dock. Let's meet there.
2120016238/Yes.
2120016239/Excellent, and the bad news?
2120016240/Damn! There's more. Inside the cave, go straight until you find a small passage...
2120016241/Squeeze through, into the Old Manor's catacombs. Then, you're on your own.
2120016242/We'll wait here.
2120016243/Attack.
2120016244/Mhm. I don't know if I can help you, with fierce fighting in that area. The Grand Master is to command the offensive personally. I may be summoned shortly.
2120016245/I'll escort you, at least part way through the swamps.
2120016246/What now?
2120016247/I'm going to Vizima with the Grand Master. I'll come and help as soon as I can.
2120016248/See you.
2120016249/Shani's an angel! I swear on the Eternal Fire, her hands work miracles!
2120016250/Arrrgh...
2120016251/Swung by a berserk butcher dwarf. He cut down three brothers, but I got him!
2120016252/Merely a scratch. Shani confirmed I'd be back on my feet in no time.
2120016253/A great loss for the Order. I must inform the Grand Master. He was last seen near the swamp cemetery.
2120016254/We should go immediately.
2120016255/Rayla is trapped at the barricade! We must help her!
2120016256/A fine warrior. May the Eternal Fire illuminate her soul.
2120016257/Attack!
2120016258/Area secured! We must break through the barricade!
2120016259/Geralt! Destroy the barricade!
2120016260/We must get to the other side!
2120016261/For the Flaming Rose!
2120016262/We'll flank them!
2120016263/We must get to the other flank! To Rayla!
2120016264/Chaarge!
2120016265/On my honor, that's no way for a lady to speak...
2120016266/I do and I understand. And I shall do everything to save the Order... my King.
2120016267/Let's speak with the king. He must learn the truth before he passes rash judgment on the Order.
2120016268/Though the Grand Master violated his oath, not all knights have lost both mind and conscience.
2120016269/I don't know if I can raise my hand against a knight of the Order.
2120016270/The bastards! Geralt, I knew him. He was still a human a month ago! Shorter than me!
2120016271/It's the Greater Brothers! They wouldn't let me near that project! That is an offense to humanity!
2120016272/I know you're an atheist, but I wanted to ask you to pray before you confront Jacques de Aldersberg.
2120016273/I can't believe Jacques de Aldersberg is a traitor... I can't.
2120016274/You'll see.
2120016275/We must pass through the sewers to get the monastery. The entrance is somewhere around here.
2120016276/There's a huge zeugl grown fat on carrion sitting in the sewers.
2120016277/There's fighting everywhere...
2120016278/AAAAAARGHHH!!! Hell!!! Again!
2120016279/Hurry, Geralt!
2120016280/Once again I'm wounded in the leg before a glorious battle! Geralt, I cannot go on! AAARGGHH!!!
2120016281/We must hurry!
2120016282/Geralt, go! I shall gather what knights have remained faithful to the Order's tenets.
2120016283/We must hurry!
2120016284/Geralt, there's really a zeugl down there.
2120016285/Faith and lack thereof differ in that faith can work miracles, while its lack can do nothing.
2120016286/That's sick! Unnatural even for monsters! We must slay it!
2120016287/I heard of one zeugl, and from what I know you need two to multiply...
2120016288/Stop barking, Wolf, and draw your sword.
2120016289/You were wrong to cross me.
2120016290/I need not listen to you. You're not even human.
2120016291/Begone, before I change my mind.
2120016292/Stand aside. I have my orders. We must save this kingdom.
2120016293/Move, Geralt. I don't want to fight.
2120016294/Our Greater Brothers are no mutants, but a new race. A new hope. Sadly, innocents will inevitably perish.
2120016295/They better leave. People! Flee this place. Your king may provide shelter in these terrible times.
2120016296/True. We must fight the real enemy, those elven rejects. Boys! Form up!
2120016297/Unbelievable, they're attacking civilians.
2120016298/You claim to protect humans, yet you've thrown them to the beast. Why? Because you're not human yourself.
2120016299/Why am I talking to you?
2120016300/I should've seen your true face and killed you when I had the chance.
2120016301/Draw your sword, freak!
2120016302/You thought you could stand aside.
2120016303/A machine created to kill, you had no choice. Your time has passed.
2120016304/You won't get the chance.
2120016305/The Order could've saved humanity.
2120016306/Flaming Rose!
2120016307/Yield!
2120016308/Sword of the Order!
2120016309/Greetings, monster slayer.
2120016310/For the faithful!
2120016311/Virtue prevails!
2120016312/For victory!
2120016313/Honor or death!
2120016314/Witcher.
2120016315/Onward!
2120016316/Raise your swords!
2120016317/Retreat!
2120016318/What does that mean, Geralt?
2120016319/Eternal Fire protect us.
2120016320/Flaming Rose!
2120016321/Yield!
2120016322/Sword of the Order!
2120016323/Hmm...
2120016324/Virtue prevails!
2120016325/De Aldersberg!
2120016326/Victory!
2120016327/Honor or death!
2120016328/Not good...
2120016329/Witcher.
2120016330/Good to see you.
2120016331/Retreat!
2120016332/Charge!
2120016333/Onward, knightly brethren!
2120016334/What does that mean, Geralt?
2120016335/Flaming Rose!
2120016336/Yield!
2120016337/For the Order!
2120016338/Greetings, monster slayer.
2120016339/You're here!
2120016340/For the Flaming Rose!
2120016341/Virtue prevails!
2120016342/For victory!
2120016343/Steel against steel!
2120016344/Attack!
2120016345/Forward!
2120016346/Retreat!
2120016347/What does that mean, Geralt?
2120016348/With fire eternal like hope...
2120016349/That's the way it must be for we burn,
2120016350/Forgive me, I meant no harm. I'm Siegfried, a Knight of the Order of the Flaming Rose.
2120016351/You witchers are relics and few in number. You're no competition - the Order demands no payment for protecting humans.
2120016352/A cockatrice, correct? That's why I'm here.
2120016353/Yes?
2120016354/It threatens Vizima. The Order's been fighting beasts for a while. Rather effectively, too.
2120016355/I've no desire to argue. We're both here. There's no reason to await the other's turn, especially while there are drowners here too. Let's join forces instead. I long to see your combat skills and I assure you my sword is at your disposal.
2120016356/I've heard much praise concerning the combat skills of witchers.
2120016357/The sacred flame will guide me.
2120016358/No, I wasn't at home at the time. When I returned, I discovered my father, despite his infirmity, had decided to fight the manticore. He asked to be tied to a horse and with a prayer, he charged the beast.
2120016359/Its eyes are quite a versatile component -- and precious. Its tail feathers are even more valuable.
2120016360/I confess my knowledge of monsters ends with the cockatrice. My late father, Eyck of Denesle, may he rest in peace, left me an engraving of the beast. There were many more engravings but they were lost inside a manticore's stomach. Only the cockatrice's image survived.
2120016361/You'll need to excel at swordsmanship. Without a silver sword, it'll be more difficult. A cockatrice likes to sneak up from behind and attack.
2120016362/The cockatrice is frequently mistaken for a basilisk - but they're two separate species. Contrary to common belief, the cockatrice's gaze does not turn people to stone, but one should beware of its beak. The monster's beak is apt to tear its opponents' vital organs out with surgical precision. Often, the victim is slain immediately, especially when taken from behind.
2120016363/Cockatrices, also known as skoffins, are a kind of ornithosaur. They're twice the size of a large bird. The link between reptiles and birds, they resemble roosters, hence their common name...
2120016364/As you will. But don't be surprised to see the cockatrice's corpse. Farewell.
2120016365/You lead.
2120016366/May he rest in peace.
2120016367/All right, what do you want to know?
2120016368/As you can surmise, he met a tragic end.
2120016369/In brief, witcher, the cockatrice is an overgrown rooster, but far more dangerous.
2120016370/When I reached the site of their struggle, the monster was in horrible pain, seconds from dying. When it could not dislodge my father from his armor, it nearly swallowed the old man whole. Later they would say the sacred fire in Eyck's soul burnt the monster's heart.
2120016371/Oh, you're a witcher...?
2120016372/White hair, vertical pupils... signs of mutation....
2120016373/We'll speak later. The cockatrice is a dangerous foe.
2120016374/Out of my way, witcher.
2120016375/I have things to attend to at my quarters. Then I'll venture out in search of beasts, as the world is still filled with them.
2120016376/Hmm. A limited number of suspects. You'll likely solve the mystery when you find the leader of those bandits. I have a friend in Vizima, a detective. See him for help.
2120016377/Let us go.
2120016378/If you ever need me, I'll be at my quarters in Vizima.
2120016379/Friends of yours?
2120016380/Your sarcasm is unnecessary. We're on the same side, witcher. You'll realize this one day.
2120016381/We might meet again if you ever visit the sewers. At times I venture down here in search of monsters.
2120016382/Here's the key for the passage to town. A few days ago, I locked the door to keep the cockatrice in.
2120016383/Make sure you get everything. Jethro is known to have sticky fingers.
2120016384/Who knew you'd be in the sewers?
2120016385/I do. Take the cockatrice's head and follow me.
2120016386/Don't forget your trophy. Vincent put a price on the cockatrice's head.
2120016387/Come, I'll lead you to the exit. Take the cockatrice's head. Vincent pays well for trophies.
2120016388/Well, well, the cockatrice dissected, nice and clean.
2120016389/The cockatrice is dead. Now, where was the exit?
2120016390/I suspected it would interest you. Have you proof of slaying 10 drowners?
2120016391/You mean beasts to capture or kill? The Order of the Flaming Rose manages well in that respect. However...
2120016392/However, recent happenings have engaged all our forces and we received a request - monsters threaten the boat landing in the swamp.
2120016393/When?
2120016394/Before you say no, let me give you some details.
2120016395/I shall certainly attend.
2120016396/Allow me to draw your attention to a few important matters. Primo: the Order was created to serve humble folk; secundo: anyone can join - peasant, nobleman or witcher. Tertio: Knights of the Order enjoy many privileges...
2120016397/Not the Order, certainly. Inquire with merchants in Vizima. A wealthy man named Leuvaarden signed the request.
2120016398/Geralt, I was wondering if you'd care to join the Order...
2120016399/Humph.
2120016400/Quarto: Knights of the Order pursue monsters. What do you think?
2120016401/Return when you have their tongues.
2120016402/Wait, I must record this... 10 drowners... Good, here's your gold.
2120016403/Geralt, good to see you. Where are you going?
2120016404/Gentlemen, that's no way to treat a hero. Geralt, the witcher that saved Vizima from a terrible cockatrice!
2120016405/He's almost one of us.
2120016406/See you.
2120016407/Farewell.
2120016408/The price of greatness is responsibility...
2120016409/I failed with the cockatrice. You killed the beast and I could hardly claim another's achievement. So I must put in time on watch.
2120016410/No matter. Simple service teaches humility and endurance. And you gain - they wouldn't let you pass if I weren't here, for they wouldn't know you're immune to the disease.
2120016411/Geralt, nice to see you again.
2120016412/There's iron discipline in the ranks. Aaarghh... damned thorn! Why are you still here?
2120016413/Rare criminals who supply weapons to the Scoia'tael. Their name derives from the elven word for ravenous greed.
2120016414/I thank you. The elves and hawkers are meeting at the Golem Burial Ground. Strike forcefully, with confidence. May the Eternal Fire lead you. It might not be a bad idea to imbibe one of your potions.
2120016415/Indeed. I determined he fell into Salamandra's hands. Be careful, they may want you as well.
2120016416/I'll prove it. I investigated those who attacked us in the sewers.
2120016417/It was a direct order from the Grand Master. Help me, I'll appoint you commander of my unit.
2120016418/You'll be rewarded for your dedication. The Order takes care of its friends.
2120016419/As am I. Farewell.
2120016420/Oooww! Geralt? By the Eternal Fire, it's good to see you.
2120016421/An echinops thorn pains me under my greave. I fear I cannot walk. We were seeking the Golem Burial Ground. Some fool, may the Eternal Fire illuminate the darkness of his mind, was ranting on about mosquitoes and golems when the cursed plant shot me with its thorn. Ouch!
2120016422/Witcher, your actions speak ill of you. Without my strike force, I have no means to fight the terrorists.
2120016423/We truly need your assistance.
2120016424/I believe in you, Geralt. Nothing occurs without cause. The Eternal Fire has given you both honor and responsibility...
2120016425/Good to see you.
2120016426/No time for trivial matters. Elves and hawkers are dealing at the burial ground. My duty was to eliminate the hawkers and the Scoia'tael, chopping off all the hydra's heads in one fell swoop.
2120016427/How did the battle end?
2120016428/How did it end?
2120016429/I suspected it would interest you. Have proof of slaying 10 drowners?
2120016430/Hurry, before they discover us.
2120016431/Stay, I must record this... 10 drowners... Good, here's your gold.
2120016432/Friends need to help each other.
2120016433/Come back when you have the drowners' tongues.
2120016434/They're quite interested in witchers. Another appeared in Vizima before you...
2120016435/Make haste!
2120016436/It's the white-haired bastard! Kill him! The knight, too!
2120016437/That door leads out of the sewers. So, this is where we part. But...
2120016438/Odd. Few would dare venture here.
2120016439/We're near the exit.
2120016440/Cheers.
2120016441/I've never heard such nonsense in my life.
2120016442/Master Dandelion, I'm seriously concerned about your mental health.
2120016443/In the choir at the Order!
2120016444/I, too, should take my leave, but could we meet again, m'lady?
2120016445/Order and peace is our ideal!
2120016446/King Foltest, not the Order, rules here. His law must be obeyed. The nonhuman band terrorizing the area makes a mockery of the King's law.
2120016447/The quarantine is necessary to protect humans from the plague.
2120016448/I would gladly hear your opinion.
2120016449/I don't understand.
2120016450/I bow to your bravery.
2120016451/And you should see what the Scoia'tael do to their human prisoners. I'll forego the gory details in deference to Miss Shani...
2120016452/Exquisite intoxicant!
2120016453/My respects. I am Siegfried, a knight of the Order of the Flaming Rose.
2120016454/Good day.
2120016455/The Order pays the Crown its due on time.
2120016456/Geralt?
2120016457/If you're my friend, you'll not turn me down.
2120016458/Witcher, I've a favor to ask.
2120016459/I am indebted to you.
2120016460/Fetch me a bottle of liquor from downstairs.
2120016461/I wanted to thank you for your invitation and ask you, as my friend, to do me one more favor.
2120016462/My armor is quite noisy. And it's very difficult to get out of.
2120016463/Absolutely not. On my way out, I'll leave a coin pouch worth five bottles.
2120016464/Please, Geralt. I'm so keen to make a good impression on her... this wondrous virgin... Shani.
2120016465/Make haste.
2120016466/Let him finish!
2120016467/The remains of drowners. This cockatrice works wonders.
2120016468/Ger--
2120016469/Only that people truly fear to venture there, for ghouls abound.
2120016470/I'm listening.
2120016471/We defeated the Scoia'tael in the swamp. A triumphant victory...
2120016472/Greetings.
2120016473/A worthy cause... I cannot refuse.
2120016474/I know! Iron Flame!
2120016475/Do what I ask. Then we'll talk.
2120016476/I'm wondering about the introduction of martial law. I must prepare my unit. I need other assistance, however.
2120016477/We suffered heavy losses in the swamp due to the Scoia'tael. My mood is foul...
2120016478/Join us. I beseech you. Stop dealing with these nonhumans!
2120016479/Yes, why? Do you seek to become a knight?
2120016480/What is it?
2120016481/You saved innocents, no greater good could you have done. You deserve a bonus. I'm proud of you.
2120016482/I don't know if I trust you.
2120016483/You were to tend to the cemetery, not use fisstech... Unless you speak true...
2120016484/I trust you slew it. The Order thanks you. Your payment.
2120016485/What happened?
2120016486/A talking ghoul?! Perhaps you've taken one elixir too many... What happened?
2120016487/Why have you come?
2120016488/I'll pray for you.
2120016489/The cemetery cannot be inaccessible to the townsfolk.
2120016490/People disappearing in the town cemetery. Go investigate.
2120016491/Certainly, besides the Order's gratitude.
2120016492/Eternal Fire, how terrible. The Order thanks you, but cannot give you full payment since innocents died. I pray you understand.
2120016493/Thank you. I'm training new recruits. Any suggestions?
2120016494/When I've finished, these recruits will be unbeatable.
2120016495/Tell me more.
2120016496/Iron Flame - it's decided.
2120016497/A talking ghoul?! Perhaps you've taken one elixir too many... Be serious, now.
2120016498/Work hard, play hard. Any ideas on what to name my new unit?
2120016499/Eternal Fire! Like a true knight. Fret not, my units will catch the murderers.
2120016500/Jest away. The boys will accomplish much soon enough.
2120016501/Indeed, I shouldn't saddle you with work.
2120016502/Very well: Flaming Spears of Destruction!
2120016503/He's a true visionary, Geralt.
2120016504/Yes, why do you ask?
2120016505/Yes?
2120016506/A noble cause... I'll consider your request.
2120016507/You'd be eligible but medals are only awarded to knights... unless...
2120016508/I'm to receive a medal for saving the property of some townspeople!
2120016509/I'll be there.
2120016510/Okay. Any details?
2120016511/I must prepare. We'll meet there.
2120016512/They haven't set a date for the ceremony. I'm overwhelmed I'm to speak with the Grand Master afterwards.
2120016513/Is this some political plot?
2120016514/Fine - a mere scratch...
2120016515/I understand... Hey! The Grand Master himself is going to present the medal to me!
2120016516/How?
2120016517/Geralt!
2120016518/Jacques de Aldersberg, Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, is a man destined for great things.
2120016519/Are you stupid?!
2120016520/Begone elven collaborator!
2120016521/What? After your actions at the bank?
2120016522/You helped the Scoia'tael escape! We found the kikimore corpses...
2120016523/You tried to destroy the evidence. You went downstairs yourself...
2120016524/The Scoia'tael couldn't have managed on their own. If not for the law, I'd kill you myself!
2120016525/How dare you come here?!
2120016526/Leave me, traitor!
2120016527/Keep your guard up!
2120016528/Stand ready at all times.
2120016529/Put your hearts into it!
2120016530/No matter. Apparently we're to be magically transferred somewhere.
2120016531/Geralt! We were waiting...
2120016532/Quiet! I hear footsteps! Was I followed?!
2120016533/It's de Wett! Traitorous monk, a disgrace to our profession!
2120016534/We will rid Vizima of this evil once and for all!
2120016535/Triss, can you transfer us now?!
2120016536/Still needs deciding.
2120016537/He approaches!
2120016538/The Salamanders are using a magic portal to enter their base. Cursed elven magic...
2120016539/Open the gate and let the Order inside.
2120016540/Would you take on the entire base yourself?
2120016541/There's no time to lose!
2120016542/She stayed behind to deal with that lunatic De Wett. But she cast Alzur's Shield before teleporting you...
2120016543/A powerful spell... from the book you found in the swamp.
2120016544/You got hit, hard... The sorceress must have cast a protective spell...
2120016545/Geralt! Are you well?!
2120016546/Professor escaped, and that barrier blocks our path!
2120016547/She stayed behind to deal with that lunatic De Wett. She told me to warn you that Azar has gained immense power thanks to some book...
2120016548/What a blow, and a miracle you still live!
2120016549/No time to lose!
2120016550/The sorceress said it is activated by a magic stone. There is something of the sort in the cave, to the right.
2120016551/We got the key to the Town Hall. We'll surprise them from the back...
2120016552/I'd rather negotiate without an arrow in my eye.
2120016553/We'll go through the back of the Town Hall.
2120016554/Sorry I'm late, I was assembling the assault force...
2120016555/It's about time we did something.
2120016556/Go!
2120016557/Mark the archers... witcher?!
2120016558/What right...?
2120016559/That makes us allies.
2120016560/We'll try another entrance.
2120016561/Pull back!
2120016562/We're in. Onward!
2120016563/Follow me!
2120016564/For the Flaming Rose!
2120016565/I shall remember this, witcher!
2120016566/With terrorists? Never!
2120016567/Go ahead. Commit suicide. But don't take us with you.
2120016568/Why else? To be ambushed and killed?!
2120016569/If you must speak with terrorists, do it alone!
2120016570/Duan? Duan? Who is this duan they're incessantly going on about?
2120016571/To the vault! You must get their leader!
2120016572/Before it's too late!
2120016573/Witcher...
2120016574/Find their leader!
2120016575/No time to explain! Yaevinn is escaping into the sewers!
2120016576/I'm wounded! You must catch Yaevinn in the sewers!
2120016577/You chose wisely! The Order of the Flaming Rose will be grateful!
2120016578/The Eternal Fire guides me!
2120016579/You know where to find me.
2120016580/It seems he escaped.
2120016581/Am I to be embroiled in some political plot?
2120016582/Thanks to your aid... How can I reward you?
2120016583/Interesting idea, but how?
2120016584/All right. Any details?
2120016585/I'll be there.
2120016586/Oh! How horrible. I've never been so scared.
2120016587/I'm going to the druids' cave. My patients need their medication.
2120016588/I have to wait. Preparing medicines is apparently even more complicated than brewing potions.
2120016589/Geralt...
2120016590/See you.
2120016591/No need. There's unlikely to be many monsters after that massacre.
2120016592/See you.
2120016593/I never could've done it without you.
2120016594/I'll be safe in the druids' cave nearby.
2120016595/No, I'll manage. Go save the world.
2120016596/I need a drink. I can't believe they wanted to slaughter us!
2120016597/I must reach the swamp cemetery. Half these wretches won't see tomorrow without the druids' medication...
2120016598/Thanks, I'll follow you.
2120016599/Lead the way.
2120016600/Out the back.
2120016601/Let's go. Out the back... evade the fighting.
2120016602/Melitele protect us.
2120016603/Quiet!
2120016604/Let's get out of here!
2120016605/A little further.
2120016606/Bad news... I peeked down the alley...
2120016607/It's our only way... and it's teeming with necrophages.
2120016608/The fire must've drawn them here. More down that way...
2120016609/I didn't even see this many after the Battle of Brenna...
2120016610/We have to get through!
2120016611/Things are getting worse...
2120016612/Use the Aard Sign!
2120016613/We might want to find another path...
2120016614/So, this is the only way. Let's go.
2120016615/You're late... The attackers are already dead. Now please leave. You're scaring the wounded.
2120016616/Are you blind?! This is a hospital, not a hideout!
2120016617/Out of my hospital! Murder each other to your hearts' content in the street! But don't show your faces here!
2120016618/First, a kiss.
2120016619/Come back later.
2120016620/For you, always. I missed you.
2120016621/I have my hands full. Besides, I'm apparently not worthy of your trust.
2120016622/Don't be embarrassed.
2120016623/Enough! The wounded need my help.
2120016624/Clever.
2120016625/Welcome.
2120016626/Alvin! You made it perfectly clear who's worthy of a witcher's trust and who's not! Who you'd sleep with on occasion and who you'd entrust with a child!
2120016627/Do what you must, we'll speak later.
2120016628/They wanted to slay the wounded. How can anyone fall so low?!
2120016629/Thank you, on behalf of all the patients.
2120016630/Need help?
2120016631/Farewell.
2120016632/No harm can come to any patient in my hospital!
2120016633/Hold me.
2120016634/They attacked the hospital! Unbelievable!
2120016635/What happened with the striga?
2120016636/Oh, Geralt, I missed you so badly.
2120016637/Looks like everything's in order...
2120016638/For me they aren't enemies, just wounded. In this hospital we make no racial or political distinctions.
2120016639/You seem to be in one piece.
2120016640/What's that? What's going on?!
2120016641/Where's Alvin?
2120016642/Geralt...
2120016643/Let me decide.
2120016644/I came to understand that at Brenna... Rusty treated Nilfgaardians and our own, even shielded a patient with his own body when elves showed up... If they come here, I hope I have the courage to protect my patients.
2120016645/They won't come here...
2120016646/Geralt, I don't want to lose you...
2120016647/Me, too.
2120016648/Let's hope he's in good hands.
2120016649/Hold me, Geralt, just one last time...
2120016650/I don't have to, I can treat people anywhere.
2120016651/What are you thinking?
2120016652/I'll wait, Geralt! Do what you must, kick some ass and come back to me!
2120016653/Nice to hear. Why are you telling me this? What's that sound?!
2120016654/Holy Melitele! More outside!
2120016655/Go on alone.
2120016656/Look! Alvin!
2120016657/Are you all right?
2120016658/You may encounter strange things, the consequences of your decisions. There's nothing behind us but a blizzard, and nothing beyond it but death.
2120016659/More a vision born in the mind of the Grand Master... flashes of the future colored by his fears and beliefs.
2120016660/None can enter the heart of the vision, besides you. The Grand Master won't allow it.
2120016661/Be safe.
2120016662/I'll follow, in case you need help.
2120016663/It's not far now.
2120016664/That is the nature of this place.
2120016665/Ha!
2120016666/Don't kill me!
2120016667/Oo!
2120016668/I'm glad to see you.
2120016669/Oh, you're here. I fear for you...
2120016670/Defend yourself!
2120016671/Oh, Geralt. What is this?
2120016672/Nice thought, but take it away.
2120016673/Geralt! Look!
2120016674/Hi, Geralt.
2120016675/I dissected a drowned dead once...
2120016676/Guards won't talk to me. He must be important - they want a quick recovery.
2120016677/No, I'm needed here. Few have your immunity.
2120016678/I've a room in the northeastern end of Vizima.
2120016679/Wait a moment.
2120016680/I'm going to the hospital... Let's talk there.
2120016681/Quickly, I need to get back to work.
2120016682/We don't have a cure for the plague yet, but... did you know Rusty?
2120016683/Some people died at the hospital. Were you involved?
2120016684/Told you all I know.
2120016685/Celandine. Thanks. Do you need some help?
2120016686/I've heard about your deeds.
2120016687/Hmm... I'll tell you what I overheard. The prisoner will be transported to a safe location.
2120016688/Then don't count on my assistance.
2120016689/I miss Oxenfurt sometimes.
2120016690/Visit me at home... the hospital's no place for personal matters.
2120016691/Before the plague took him, he discovered certain plant extracts retarded the disease's progress.
2120016692/Come back in the evening. The guards might be more talkative, especially with strong drink in hand.
2120016693/If you need anything, let me know.
2120016694/Just watching out for you.
2120016695/I've a room in the northern end of town. Stop by after work.
2120016696/What? That's illegal!
2120016697/Come back later.
2120016698/Celandine... the more you bring, the better.
2120016699/Visit me at night - we'll talk.
2120016700/Explain yourself!
2120016701/I'm fighting the plague. No time for chitchat.
2120016702/Geralt, we need to talk.
2120016703/They delivered this badly injured man.
2120016704/Yes, the best one's celandine. Unfortunately, it's only found on swampy ground...
2120016705/Every blossom counts... Bring at least five sprouts.
2120016706/Excellent. I'm really grateful...
2120016707/Opposite the house, there's a small square with a sculpture of a snake.
2120016708/Can it wait?
2120016709/Your skills are no good here.
2120016710/I can tell you of bloedzuigers...
2120016711/I know about fleders...
2120016712/Geralt! You managed to get out of prison!
2120016713/Ready for the autopsy?
2120016714/We'll take a look at your dead guy in a minute.
2120016715/Slow down, Geralt.
2120016716/It could've been ghouls...
2120016717/Whatever you say. He died yesterday, torn to pieces.
2120016718/We'll find out...
2120016719/The wounds can't explain that.
2120016720/Normally I base it on muscle stiffness and dehydration. But rigor mortis is persisting for too long...
2120016721/Nothing. Anyone can cut somebody up like that.
2120016722/No indication of other symptoms...
2120016723/Let's check his internal organs.
2120016724/I also see some stab wounds - a blade two fingers wide.
2120016725/It'd be nice to find something conclusive.
2120016726/The moon's shining. Wouldn't he turn into a lycanthrope?
2120016727/Only with a two-foot jaw.
2120016728/Geralt, no need to test me. I'm a professional. Moving on...
2120016729/Race: human, gender: male, wounds: extensive...
2120016730/Very likely... plenty around the cemetery.
2120016731/We'll begin in a minute.
2120016732/Yes. It also caused convulsions, paralysis and cardiac arrest. That explains why rigor mortis lasted so long.
2120016733/Geralt, I detest indecisive men. I'll help with my medical knowledge, but I'm no investigator!
2120016734/Perforated. Odd, the weapon didn't hit any vital organs.
2120016735/Let's open the thorax.
2120016736/Completely cirrhotic, but he doesn't look a drunk.
2120016737/So far, yes.
2120016738/They could have purchased it from someone. There's a shifty looking merchant among them.
2120016739/The heart's untouched, but the aorta's been cut by a dagger.
2120016740/Alchemists' poisons usually leave a trace. Let's have a look.
2120016741/Where shall we start?
2120016742/Then decide - the patient's decomposing.
2120016743/Yes.
2120016744/No hurry.
2120016745/If they were, we'd see pneumothorax.
2120016746/Yes, an average surgeon could cure you. At worst, you'd spend the rest of your life whistling when you breathed.
2120016747/Completely cirrhotic. A strong poison affected the nervous system. Practically unavailable.
2120016748/If he didn't die from stab wounds, it's most likely poison. Let's examine the liver.
2120016749/Hold on a second.
2120016750/He wasn't killed with a weapon. What next?
2120016751/The blade severed the aorta, but internal bleeding is limited.
2120016752/A gifted alchemist could obtain it.
2120016753/As I suspected - he didn't die from stab wounds.
2120016754/Alchemical poisons cause certain changes.
2120016755/Precisely. Someone stabbed a dead body.
2120016756/Just a second...
2120016757/Yes, alchemists' poisons usually cause certain characteristic changes.
2120016758/The symptoms are peculiar and the cause of death, too.
2120016759/Life can be simple sometimes.
2120016760/The most likely cause.
2120016761/We can try the coroner's last resort-- opening the skull.
2120016762/If so, a rare sort. Perhaps an alchemist's brew.
2120016763/Ah! Liver's completely cirrhotic - it was obviously a potent poison. This stinks of alchemy.
2120016764/Ugh, I need to bathe. See you, Geralt.
2120016765/Bandits?
2120016766/As you can see, the tongue's been removed, quite brutally, though after his death. Only why?
2120016767/Ugh, I need to bathe. See you, Geralt.
2120016768/Yes, the poison caused necrosis of the tongue, so the murderer removed it.
2120016769/Look, the tongue was crudely extracted, but not all the blackened tissue was removed.
2120016770/A gifted alchemist who's a crappy surgeon.
2120016771/Good. I'm exhausted.
2120016772/What will you do now?
2120016773/Or fisstech.
2120016774/From your friend, the detective. He told me it was from special stock.
2120016775/Geralt... I gave him fisstech before he died! He was suffering terribly, and we had no other anesthetics. I thought it was safe...
2120016776/But I saw him just yesterday...
2120016777/We're in Temeria.
2120016778/Be careful, Geralt. Please don't underestimate Javed.
2120016779/Opening the skull... always a pleasure. See that in the brain?
2120016780/That doesn't sound like Raymond at all...
2120016781/Then we have a problem.
2120016782/What do these eggs look like?
2120016783/But... how did they get in his brain?
2120016784/The coats were supposed to hide them. They didn't know at university I learned to recognize their kind...
2120016785/Some people died in a fight at the hospital. Were you involved?
2120016786/Thanks. Sometimes it's good to share...
2120016787/Geralt, we need to talk.
2120016788/I hope you don't think I'm after money!
2120016789/Hmm. Anyway, the prisoner is being transported to a safe location.
2120016790/Get the body from the gravedigger. We'll meet at the hospital in the evening.
2120016791/Well... this gloomy fellow scared everyone else away...
2120016792/Explain yourself!
2120016793/But that's it. I'm not sorry. I wake up refreshed and it's like I'm used to suffering. Does that make sense?
2120016794/You know how to apologize to a woman.
2120016795/I have a room... Vizima's northeastern end.
2120016796/Foltest's secret police. When we first met in Oxenfurt, I helped you evade Redanian agents. The Temerian ones are little better...
2120016797/They walked me home. I heard an "invisible" one say their operation against Salamandra had failed...
2120016798/Different colors mean different things. Red roses, for instance, signify love...
2120016799/Thaler said to the men, "This better be important!" One of them answered, "But chief, we hid invisible-like."
2120016800/Red roses... Geralt... So you...
2120016801/I'd like to ask a favor.
2120016802/Cherry vodka for Dandelion, rosé wine for me... and something for you.
2120016803/I would've given you the Sephira, anyway... I never expected such a beautiful ring...
2120016804/An autopsy? Since when do you deal with stuff like that?
2120016805/Okay, though I'm no coroner. You'll have to interpret our findings. We'll meet in the evening. Until then, gather as many clues as possible.
2120016806/That's right... how did you know?
2120016807/I worked alongside a surgeon named Rusty, best doctor I ever knew...
2120016808/He died when the catriona plague erupted... in Maribor. Though a halfling, he could operate like no one else... He made everything seem simple.
2120016809/Stitch red to red, yellow to yellow, white to white, and everything will be all right. Ah, you wouldn't understand...
2120016810/How'd you get past the old hag?
2120016811/You should have respect for tradition.
2120016812/I don't want to talk about it.
2120016813/Yes, at least my rent is low... Doctors earn little in Temeria, many leave...
2120016814/Yes?
2120016815/I get flowers so rarely...
2120016816/I'm still waiting for the gold ring.
2120016817/I thought we were going to be arrested, then Thaler told me not to worry - duty called and we needed to part.
2120016818/We'll talk later.
2120016819/Me?!
2120016820/How did you find me?
2120016821/This is nothing like Oxenfurt.
2120016822/Thaler said, "Your balls will be invisible-like when I shove them up your arse." I couldn't help but burst out laughing...
2120016823/I was about to give him a piece of my mind when I noticed the men giving him signals...
2120016824/Please accept this amulet...
2120016825/Great, I don't know how to thank you...
2120016826/If you need anything...
2120016827/Remember Dandelion? Well... we're trying to organize a gathering...
2120016828/To reminisce, have a few drinks... however...
2120016829/You guessed it. And I don't want to serve just anything.
2120016830/I'm in no hurry.
2120016831/Splendid! Bring a friend!
2120016832/Mhm.
2120016833/He died during the Battle at Brenna... on my operating table.
2120016834/No... But you should ask the dwarf, Zoltan Chivay. His knowledge of weapons is unmatched.
2120016835/Ah, right... I work in a hospital.
2120016836/Finally, you found me.
2120016837/It's not her fault how she was raised.
2120016838/She's made my life hell.
2120016839/That's what she thinks.
2120016840/Hi, Geralt.
2120016841/There's a sculpture of a snake in front of the house.
2120016842/Someone had to.
2120016843/What is it?
2120016844/Hi. Come to my place if you want to talk.
2120016845/Ask Vincent Meis but also look for books on anatomy and pathology.
2120016846/Just watching out for you.
2120016847/Thought you'd never ask...
2120016848/Wait. I was curious, so I said he broke my heart and faked fainting.
2120016849/Thaler - I doubt you know him. We were walking along the dike one evening when I realized we were being followed by two men wearing grey coats over special forces armor.
2120016850/We're waiting on you.
2120016851/I wanted to talk...
2120016852/Sometimes I dream about the Battle of Brenna... the massacre...
2120016853/No, I'm fine. He was mysterious, even charming in a peculiar way. We actually went out a few times, and who knows what might've happened if I hadn't discovered he was leading a double life...
2120016854/Lovely roses, Geralt... I warm to gestures like this.
2120016855/Invited anyone yet?
2120016856/The Beast!!!
2120016857/What was that?!
2120016858/You should talk to the Reverend. He might have some information.
2120016859/They've been terrorizing the village for some time. Every few days, a villager is killed. The pack is led by a large hound, perhaps a wolf. People call it the Beast.
2120016860/I told you all I know.
2120016861/Never mind. What's past is past.
2120016862/The old elven prophecy of Itlina. I hope he's all right.
2120016863/The boy was delirious, muttered something about a ransom and the Reverend. Sadly, he grew feverish and he died that night.
2120016864/Once I've helped the victims of the dog attacks, I guess. I can't abandon them. It'll delay me, but some are certain to die without my aid.
2120016865/I'm traveling to St. Lebioda's Hospital in Vizima to help fight the catriona plague.
2120016866/Abigail, a local soothsayer, offered to care for him. I hope I did right entrusting the boy to her.
2120016867/I wouldn't want to be them.
2120016868/Thanks, Geralt.
2120016869/I don't know. I'll look after him for now. Maybe a villager will take him in.
2120016870/She seems strange...
2120016871/Come, let's tend to Alvin.
2120016872/I see.
2120016873/Hm. I'm afraid I can't help. Medicine is a fledgling science here in the north. I can say that your memory might come back on its own.
2120016874/It's me, Shani, don't you recognize me? What ever happened to you? I heard you died during a massacre in Rivia.
2120016875/I hate to admit it, but sorcerers are somewhat more effective at this than we are. Maybe one of them could help.
2120016876/We had a beautiful friendship until Dandelion crept through my window.
2120016877/Did you want to ask me something?
2120016878/I think they're a group of bandits who terrify the locals. Yesterday they returned a boy they'd whipped with a lamia.
2120016879/Why the interest in Salamandra?
2120016880/Shhh, not so loud. There was someone, but the peasants grow silent at the mere mention of him. The Reverend might know more. You may also want to ask him about the Beast.
2120016881/That's what witchers do, isn't it? But enough about monsters. What brings you here?
2120016882/Yes, seems so. Oh! I do hope he's not hurt. I'll need to find someone to take care of him. He shouldn't be alone. We'll stay at the inn in the meantime.
2120016883/Sorry, Geralt, I forgot. Dandelion's our friend. He has a talent for showing up at the wrong time.
2120016884/A Mayhen crop with small barbs and hooks. It rips away skin and flesh with each strike. Most civilized countries have banned them.
2120016885/So am I.
2120016886/No, leave me alone!
2120016887/Quickly, Geralt! Let's leave this cursed place. The city gates are just up the road.
2120016888/That was some swift swordwork. As for me, I'm done delaying. I need to get to Vizima. I hope to see you there.
2120016889/I'll be waiting.
2120016890/These are hardly pleasant times, Geralt. The plague, impending wars...
2120016891/No.
2120016892/Geralt, are you all right? I was so worried!
2120016893/No, you need to deal with the Salamanders. Don't worry about me. I'll wait for you here. Make them suffer, Geralt. For me.
2120016894/I am now. They surprised me... All the peasants ran out and I was trapped. They killed the innkeeper...
2120016895/It sounds like a fairy tale.
2120016896/Keep your hands off me!
2120016897/Come.
2120016898/I'll wait for you here. Go.
2120016899/Geralt, you arrived just in time!
2120016900/Geralt, you arrived just in time!
2120016901/Calm down, everything'll be okay.
2120016902/Destroy these dogs or we'll die!!
2120016903/Let's go.
2120016904/Geralt, talk to the guard. Let's get out of here.
2120016905/...and the peasants...
2120016906/Vizima lies beyond this gate. I hope we never return here.
2120016907/What does Carmen do for a living?
2120016908/The court... Fascinating.
2120016909/Wait. What's your connection to the men present here?
2120016910/Dandelion's a notorious lecher, but you, Geralt? I'm disappointed.
2120016911/Who's your lady friend?
2120016912/Doubt it.
2120016913/It's a brilliant idea!
2120016914/Dandelion's right! Five lovers in the first few pages.
2120016915/Umm... professional curiosity. I was researching the influence of mutagens on a witcher's physical condition. I admit I found no defects. Speaking of which, you could use some exercise, Dandelion. It's good for your health.
2120016916/Unfair. I can't anger the old lady. She'll throw me out!
2120016917/Oo! Someone's coming.
2120016918/Cheers!
2120016919/I just don't get it. Dandelion, what's your point?
2120016920/To Rusty!
2120016921/I just don't get it. Dandelion, what's your point?
2120016922/To Rusty!
2120016923/No, I don't get it either. Dandelion, what's your point?
2120016924/Rusty!
2120016925/All right, that's enough. Party's over.
2120016926/Give it a rest, Dandelion.
2120016927/Why did you bring a courtesan here?
2120016928/Oh, yes.
2120016929/Won't you stay longer, Siegfried, sing me some monastic songs...?
2120016930/I didn't know you could sing...
2120016931/Let's have it!
2120016932/Sing away, Dandelion!
2120016933/Hi, Geralt. Dandelion can't wait to see you.
2120016934/While we're waiting, let's drink to old friendships.
2120016935/No, but I'd love to meet him.
2120016936/Hm. Maybe.
2120016937/So, everything's ready...
2120016938/We'll see. Let's drink to old friendships.
2120016939/You invite anyone?
2120016940/Where'd you get that idea?
2120016941/What is it?
2120016942/With four of us and thousands wounded, I never left the tent.
2120016943/It was one of the worst days of my life.
2120016944/Wrong feeling.
2120016945/Quite a pace you've set...
2120016946/What is it?
2120016947/He's nice.
2120016948/Quite a pace you've set...
2120016949/It was one of the worst days of my life.
2120016950/With four of us and thousands of wounded, I never left the tent.
2120016951/What is it?
2120016952/With four of us and thousands of wounded, I never left the tent.
2120016953/It was one of the worst days of my life.
2120016954/I like him.
2120016955/Quite a pace you've set...
2120016956/The old lady snores like a troll but sleeps lightly.
2120016957/Just a second, I'm talking to Dandelion.
2120016958/It's completely dark down there.
2120016959/Quiet, Dandelion's singing...
2120016960/Even so, the war with Nilfgaard didn't hurt Mahakam much.
2120016961/I prefer wine but don't mind liquor, in moderation.
2120016962/It's an excellent disinfectant, yes...
2120016963/Just don't get caught, Geralt. I'll pay for them tomorrow.
2120016964/I was only doing my job. Now, I suggest Dandelion play for us. Something apolitical.
2120016965/Shani, welcome.
2120016966/Wine? Geralt got some alcohol despite the quarantine.
2120016967/Quickly! Help her!
2120016968/Geralt!! Melitele must have sent you. There's a woman outside! The dogs will tear her apart! Help her!
2120016969/NOT_USED
2120016970/There's a child in the house. Be quiet and go to bed...
2120016971/Is all well, Geralt?
2120016972/Geralt! It's beautiful....
2120016973/Stop playing the alienated mutant, I hate that... Take some time to think, and when you decide you can give me a symbolic gift, say a ring...
2120016974/I was hoping for an amber and silver ring... proof of love, not riches...
2120016975/I've given a lot of thought to the future, to us...
2120016976/It's wonderful, but I can't accept it... Geralt, I'm really worried about Alvin. I was hoping... you might spend some time with him. The boy's grown fussy, needs a father... Could you talk to him?
2120016977/I understand discipline... but Alvin's suffered so much... Maybe you should be a bit easier on him...
2120016978/How could you?! She cast a spell on you! Out of my sight! I will forget your very name!
2120016979/Unlike that witch, I can't read your mind, so if you have anything to tell me...
2120016980/You're a dear! And you were so good with Alvin...
2120016981/Geralt? Are you about to vomit?
2120016982/You're not welcome here. Go back to your sorceress.
2120016983/Shhhh... Alvin's asleep...
2120016984/No gift will also mean something... I'll be waiting. I love you, Geralt.
2120016985/I'm happy you and Alvin get along. He treats you like a father, you know?
2120016986/What are you doing here?
2120016987/Honey, could you spend some time with Alvin? You're his only role model...
2120016988/I knew I could rely on you. I'm delighted you brought him to me. One last matter - return to that sorceress and inform her the child stays with me. Finish the deed once and for all, if you please. When you return, I may well show you some of my own magic...
2120016989/Yes. Dandelion brought him here and explained. I'm proud of you.
2120016990/All right, I'll wait. Do what you must.
2120016991/I knew I could trust in you.
2120016992/Say no more. I want to make love...
2120016993/I know. Dandelion told me. Why is the boy still with Triss?
2120016994/Fetch the child. I'll see you at the house.
2120016995/I don't want her handling that child with her dirty paws. Devil only knows what she wants with him. Explain to her that Alvin's staying with me.
2120016996/Okay, gimme a kiss...
2120016997/Simple or not, you know her better. Please bring Alvin to me.
2120016998/That witch is trying to steal one of my patients - Alvin. What does that hag know about raising children? Everyone knows she can't have her own.
2120016999/I'll show you my other, less tender side if you're lying.
2120017000/Why were you in that witch's house?!
2120017001/Flee!
2120017002/I want to live!
2120017003/Your end is nigh.
2120017004/Halt or I'll turn you to ash.
2120017005/At him! Attack!
2120017006/Follow me!
2120017007/Up to your ears in shit.
2120017008/Onward, attack!
2120017009/Oh, you son of a wandering elven whore!
2120017010/Definitely not.
2120017011/Gotta take a piss.
2120017012/No prisoners!
2120017013/I'll rip your gut open.
2120017014/Don't hurt me!
2120017015/Retreat, hear me?!
2120017016/Stay away, bastard.
2120017017/Where's the action?
2120017018/Attack, follow me!
2120017019/Death!
2120017020/All together, at him!
2120017021/Die, swine!
2120017022/Waste of my time.
2120017023/No wonder, given Azar Javed's persuasiveness.
2120017024/A powerful mage. You're no match for him.
2120017025/That lice-ridden village hick Odo came to us for advice on how to kill a warrior.
2120017026/We said someone so pathetic could only fight soldiers in dreams.
2120017027/Your courage isn't lacking, witcherette. We'll see how you fare after Azar gets you...
2120017028/We don't have what you seek!
2120017029/That dolt ran off, but during our brief acquaintance, he was certainly more talkative than you.
2120017030/You took your time.
2120017031/No longer, I'm afraid. And you... like your predecessor, you work for rapists and murders. Enjoying it?
2120017032/It's not here! They took it straight to our base in Vizima!
2120017033/NOT_USED
2120017034/Didn't hear me? Out!
2120017035/Since when does he have friends like you? Gimme the password or we'll tie your balls into a Zerrikanian knot.
2120017036/Not your concern. Get lost!
2120017037/I'm sure you'll find this funny!
2120017038/Scram!
2120017039/Come on in. Just don't do anything stupid. And say hello to Angus.
2120017040/Come in.
2120017041/I'll teach you to lie!
2120017042/We're rat catchers... Now... Bugger off!
2120017043/I'll teach you to lie!
2120017044/Say your prayers!
2120017045/That's wrong, boy.
2120017046/Private property!
2120017047/Go before I change my mind.
2120017048/Tell Angus I want my gold.
2120017049/Shove off!
2120017050/You've no business here!
2120017051/Silence!! I won't hurt you!
2120017052/Curses! Go to sleep!
2120017053/Who goes there?
2120017054/At them! Spare no one!
2120017055/Help!
2120017056/Run!
2120017057/This is your end.
2120017058/One more step and you're dead.
2120017059/I heard something...
2120017060/Follow me, comrades!
2120017061/You will die slow!
2120017062/You challenge Salamandra!
2120017063/Kill him!
2120017064/Interesting...
2120017065/You annoy me.
2120017066/I'll have your balls!
2120017067/Do they think this is a fucking holiday?
2120017068/Fight, you bastard!
2120017069/Help!
2120017070/Run!
2120017071/Come over here, make my day.
2120017072/Move, scum!
2120017073/Everyone follow me! Follow me!
2120017074/Kill the bastard!
2120017075/They're yours, boys!
2120017076/What the fuck is this?
2120017077/I'll rip off their heads.
2120017078/You'll die, fool!
2120017079/Help!
2120017080/Run!
2120017081/Damned fool.
2120017082/No passage. Only death beyond this point.
2120017083/Fucking louts!
2120017084/Everyone follow me! Follow me!
2120017085/I'll cut you in two!
2120017086/Get him!
2120017087/You know what to do.
2120017088/What the fuck is this?
2120017089/How'd he get in here?!
2120017090/To arms!
2120017091/Enemy!
2120017092/To work, sloths!
2120017093/Move your arse or you'll work all day!
2120017094/It's a work camp, not a picnic!
2120017095/Come on.
2120017096/Onward, at them!
2120017097/Die, shiteater!
2120017098/You're dead.
2120017099/Run!
2120017100/Stop or die.
2120017101/Shit.
2120017102/Everybody follow me!
2120017103/Hit him! Kill him!
2120017104/I'll kill you!
2120017105/Argh, waste of my time.
2120017106/No tribute, no entry.
2120017107/Where's your tribute?
2120017108/I mean the kids, fool.
2120017109/Oh, you'll give it up, gramps. Or else...
2120017110/A witcher! Kill him!
2120017111/Hrrrrr...
2120017112/Hrhrh.... zzzzt...
2120017113/Zzzzzzzt...
2120017114/You'll go no further, white one. I'll summon a powerful demon that will tear you apart!
2120017115/NOT_USED
2120017116/NOT_USED
2120017117/NOT_USED
2120017118/Everybody run! Run!
2120017119/I love this job.
2120017120/Defend yourself, bitch!
2120017121/No, don't!
2120017122/Step back or you'll leave in a coffin!
2120017123/Onward! Follow me!
2120017124/This is your final hour!
2120017125/Onward, dogs! Charge!
2120017126/I want to see corpses all around!
2120017127/My fists itch.
2120017128/Nobody messes with Salamandra! Nobody!
2120017129/You annoy me.
2120017130/Underestimating an opponent! Now the energy of my people will make me stronger!
2120017131/NOT_USED
2120017132/NOT_USED
2120017133/NOT_USED
2120017134/You're ours, witcher. You should've left Salamandra alone! This bridge will be your grave!
2120017135/City guards?! How did you...
2120017136/I told them how sharp a witcher's sword is...
2120017137/Will you fight alongside a werewolf? Our trap worked both ways.
2120017138/Witcher. Just like I said.
2120017139/Vincent... Siding with the witcher was foolish. You don't stand a chance!
2120017140/You will die!
2120017141/I saw him fighting Vincent. It was night, in the closed off part of the city...
2120017142/Come on, freak!!! Show us what you're worth!
2120017143/What are you looking at?! Fight!
2120017144/Boring.
2120017145/Take that!
2120017146/Die, bastard!
2120017147/Spare me!
2120017148/Fall back!
2120017149/Come closer and you'll die.
2120017150/Argh.
2120017151/Follow me!
2120017152/You dare challenge Salamandra!
2120017153/Kill the bastard!
2120017154/Get them!
2120017155/Stay alert.
2120017156/I won't be ridiculed.
2120017157/He's alone... The Professor promised 50 orens for every freak we kill...
2120017158/No way through here. Follow me, back to Savolla!
2120017159/Aaaagh... Ghh...
2120017160/Aghhh... Kalkstein... He...
2120017161/Kaaalksteeeiinn... aaargh...
2120017162/Arrrgh... guauuarhh...
2120017163/Why should I trust you?
2120017164/Guarantee me safety, otherwise no deal.
2120017165/Vincent, stop him! I know nothing, I was assistant to Salamandra's accountant. Javed stopped trusting me. I don't know where he is or what he intends...
2120017166/You're bluffing, you don't scare me...
2120017167/You promised me protection in exchange for me testimony...
2120017168/On my mother's grave, I know nothing! Stop him... You're a cop. This is murder, you gonna stand by and watch?
2120017169/You'll regret this, copper. Kill them!
2120017170/Who the fuck is this?
2120017171/I don't know. He went off somewhere...
2120017172/I don't trust him. Heard he was a fucking murderer, cut up over a dozen of our people...
2120017173/Who is this? This wasn't our deal, cop...
2120017174/You deaf?! Silence!
2120017175/Quiet, stupid whore!
2120017176/Silence!
2120017177/Should've accepted our offer.
2120017178/Shut up!
2120017179/Aaaargh....
2120017180/Die!
2120017181/NOT_USED
2120017182/Out, supervising transports. Saw him a month ago.
2120017183/You've entered a lion's den, wolf pup...
2120017184/We'll let you know when it's ready. Go see the chemists, down the hall, last door on the left. Push 'em - you'll get your goods faster, then.
2120017185/Okay, go in, but no trouble. How much fisstech you want?
2120017186/What's your hurry?
2120017187/Well, look who's here. Witcher Geralt.
2120017188/Who you trying to fool, witcher?
2120017189/Shove off.
2120017190/Don't do anything stupid.
2120017191/We're watching you.
2120017192/Move it! No one's allowed here except us!
2120017193/Alert! Intruder!
2120017194/Now to begin: Akhay'ala ambra ku'rr!
2120017195/There's a problem maintaining the signal...
2120017196/Sir, we're requesting financial assistance.
2120017197/Our mutual acquaintances...are working for people with close ties to you.
2120017198/Spies from Nilfgaard may have played a part.
2120017199/Our military bases around Vizima have been broken up.
2120017200/But, Sire...
2120017201/A blurry one. We may not connect with the Redanians today...
2120017202/Easy, the crystal is warming up.
2120017203/I'll boost the magical correlation.
2120017204/We're having communication problems...
2120017205/It worked. We have picture.
2120017206/Shh... Hear something? In the corridor!
2120017207/Just a moment.
2120017208/Hurry.
2120017209/This isn't working.
2120017210/We have picture...
2120017211/Greetings, sir.
2120017212/Enemy!
2120017213/Fight, bastards!
2120017214/It's that witcher!
2120017215/Theeeese 'r haaaard tiiiimes...
2120017216/Luck'ly, we're safe 'n heeeere.
2120017217/One for the other leg, oop!
2120017218/250 orens!
2120017219/Incredible! *Sniff* Have you his tooth?!!
2120017220/Greetings.
2120017221/*Sniff* powerful teeth for crushing bones and getting at the marrow...
2120017222/Witcher Geralt! *sniff* What brings you here?
2120017223/Because I'm *sniff* a collector... of teeth.
2120017224/*Sniff* excellent jaw... 50 orens *sniff*.
2120017225/I'd be elated if you helped, *sniff*.
2120017226/Fleders! They have *sniff* channels for sucking blood.
2120017227/I'll have to *sniff* crush it... My cousin gave me hammers.
2120017228/Remember, they needn't be monster teeth... I prefer unique specimens with a story to them.
2120017229/She wanted gold, then asked its source... Cousin filched it from a corpse... 125 orens.
2120017230/In appreciation *sniff*, take this dwarven sihill, G'valchir. Not for monsters *sniff*, but it slices humans nicely.
2120017231/Yes, *sniff* thanks.
2120017232/Who's... *sniff*... here?
2120017233/How can I help ya? *sniff*
2120017234/I already have those *sniff*... Ahhhh-choo! Damnable cold...
2120017235/Interesting... *sniff*... alps inject anesthetic into their victims *sniff*... perhaps I can extract it...
2120017236/I collect teeth, have I said so? And now, with the war... so many interesting specimens!
2120017237/Maybe I can synthesize an anesthetic that wouldn't aggravate my allergies... *sniff* 150 orens.
2120017238/*Sniff* they sneer until their tooth aches. Then *sniff* they crawl to me.
2120017239/100 orens.
2120017240/It was a *sniff* torture chamber.
2120017241/Schmartz, Zahin... *sniff*, dentist.
2120017242/It wasn't the groaning. It's this bloody mayhem between the elves and the Order. Though, it's given me time to pursue my passion...
2120017243/Until you get a cracked tooth.
2120017244/...the delicacy for corpse eaters. 150 orens *sniff*.
2120017245/I don't bother with the gap-toothed ones. They always spit on me... *sniff*
2120017246/*Sniff* right. Witchers slay monsters?
2120017247/Maybe. *sniff* One good thing, though. I found all the tools of my trade already here when I moved in, heheh.
2120017248/A mammoth sneeze once caused me to squeeze a patient's tongue with pliers. I can pay you only 25 orens...
2120017249/Is it? Seems like any other to me.
2120017250/No pain *sniff* in yer teeth? Schmartz, Zahin, dentist...
2120017251/Sure, *sniff*... But herbs give me allergies.
2120017252/Certainly! The rarer the better *sniff*. I'll pay!
2120017253/*Sniff* dentition like an old woman's... *Sniff* like my patient...
2120017254/Nah, the Scoia'tael protect me. They know if they lose me, they'll have to fight with wooden sticks.
2120017255/Knights of the Order tried to torch this hut twice... repelled both times.
2120017256/I'll tell you where to find it. When you get there, grab the most peculiar item you see.
2120017257/Look for a mine with a magically locked entrance. Use air and fire-based magic against a receptor concealed in a stone near the entrance. That will open the door.
2120017258/Yes! It shall serve you well.
2120017259/Good morning, sir.
2120017260/I'll always make time for a friend.
2120017261/The legendary gnomic armor... Hmm... You'll need to gather the components.
2120017262/Thank you, for the many nonhumans you saved.
2120017263/Always make time for a friend of Zoltan.
2120017264/How can I help?
2120017265/Greetings, witcher.
2120017266/Splendid! Now to connect the recirculator...
2120017267/Retrieve the armor of Graf Cobus Ruyter, the remains of Raven's armor, the notes of the elven song master, and a bi-functional alloy and fiber recirculator. You'll find these things in tombs inside the cemetery and in a mine.
2120017268/I'll work through the night. Come tomorrow.
2120017269/Two fire-based spells, followed by one air-based.
2120017270/Splendid. Two fire-based spells, followed by one air-based. Beware of danger inside the mine. Once you've gathered all the components, I'll make the suit of armor.
2120017271/The recirculator needs adjustment... hmm... three bolts, washers... DON'T BOTHER ME!!!
2120017272/The armor of Graf Cobus Ruyter, as a template. He was buried in the swamp cemetery. While you're there, visit the grave of the elven minstrel. I'll need his verses about power runes...
2120017273/A bi-functional alloy and steel fiber recirculator.
2120017274/Then you must find fragments of Raven's original armor and a certain tool...
2120017275/A witcher! That's all we need...
2120017276/Damnable sickness, I'll die here.
2120017277/Grant me a favor - smash some scoundrels from the Order.
2120017278/Ugh... I can barely speak.
2120017279/I'm infected. Stay away.
2120017280/Make sure and show up for the execution, too. They once herded me off to see a nonhuman get hanged. Let me tell you, laughed my head off.
2120017281/Yes?
2120017282/Yes, I'm a dwarf. No, I don't support the Scoia'tael. Yes, I've paid both taxes and bribes. Many times. Today, in fact.
2120017283/Greetings.
2120017284/Then ponder it on your own. Or discuss it with that maggot Brogg. I don't talk to strangers about these things.
2120017285/Why do pricks go in cunts? It's the natural order of things. Humans have always hated dwarves and elves. Not for me to know why.
2120017286/Fuck off, you won't provoke me.
2120017287/I'll be calm in my grave. Optimistically, that won't be long now.
2120017288/Terrorists or firebrands, you'd call them. They're fighting for the rights of nonhumans. Scoia'tael is elven for squirrels, called that due to the squirrel tails that dangle from their caps.
2120017289/I'm no specialist, though I can forge swords. Bring me three different ores and I'll forge you an excellent steel sword.
2120017290/Shove off, troublemaker.
2120017291/I got work to do.
2120017292/This grease improves the quality of rusty weapons. It's lard and some other ingredients. Listen...
2120017293/Neither here nor anywhere in the northern kingdoms. An official in Vizima recently won an innovation award... invented a gallows especially designed for dwarves.
2120017294/Nothing. But think of the savings! When you're producing them in the hundreds, all that extra wood can be used to make other goods - toy swords, for instance.
2120017295/Another thing - for 35 orens, you can have this excellent sword grease. It's not exactly... legal, but... I really need the gold.
2120017296/You aiming to catch me off guard or just nosy? In any case, I'll not answer you.
2120017297/Nizimir's uprising wasn't this messy.
2120017298/Even Mahakam forges aren't this hot.
2120017299/I detest humans. Understand?
2120017300/You humans always ruin things.
2120017301/I even liked this damnable city. Shame.
2120017302/Stop! Now!
2120017303/Damn, death awaits...
2120017304/Oh, the pain...
2120017305/Time to die.
2120017306/Stop this madness.
2120017307/Don' bother.
2120017308/Curses.
2120017309/What do I say?
2120017310/Wet, wet.
2120017311/Argh, damnable weather.
2120017312/Gonna hurt you.
2120017313/Time to kick your arse!
2120017314/Kill him!
2120017315/Stop it, immediately!
2120017316/All gone mad...
2120017317/Odd...
2120017318/Argh, terrible times.
2120017319/Looking for me?
2120017320/Crazy? Stop!
2120017321/You'll gain nothing that way.
2120017322/Rain, just what we needed.
2120017323/Come on.
2120017324/Really fucking wet.
2120017325/Ah, damned weather.
2120017326/Want something?
2120017327/Lovely trophy, though I'd prefer to see the head of some racist bastard.
2120017328/Heh.
2120017329/My grandma fights better.
2120017330/Enough!
2120017331/Run! Move it!
2120017332/Damn the bastards!
2120017333/Looking for a fight?
2120017334/Ah, screw it.
2120017335/Hmmm...
2120017336/Follow me, gods dammit!
2120017337/This one's asking for it. At him!
2120017338/I'll beat the shit out your arse!
2120017339/They asked for it! At them!
2120017340/You crazy, Geralt?!
2120017341/Stop! Now! At once!
2120017342/Shit in my boots.
2120017343/Screw coop-existence...
2120017344/I'm getting out of here...
2120017345/Are you crazy? Stop!
2120017346/I refuse.
2120017347/God dam rain.
2120017348/Fuck.
2120017349/Come off it.
2120017350/I don't know what to say.
2120017351/Fuck you up.
2120017352/You're due for a beating!
2120017353/Hit! Kill!
2120017354/Human footstool!
2120017355/Rather live among humans?
2120017356/They say you halted the Black Ones' charge.
2120017357/In the Free Company?
2120017358/And what good was your heroism?
2120017359/It forever rains stones on us dwarves.
2120017360/It was expected.
2120017361/And will they dispense his assets?
2120017362/What's the problem?
2120017363/Just play...
2120017364/When do you play again?
2120017365/No, I want to play cards.
2120017366/What?!
2120017367/We truly seek a fourth player.
2120017368/We need a fourth to play gwent.
2120017369/You suggesting something?
2120017370/We'll see their worth in battle.
2120017371/Those elves have some nerve.
2120017372/I'd rather befriend a boar.
2120017373/I know Thaler, so think before doing anything careless.
2120017374/Somebody was calling you down from one of those dark alleys.
2120017375/Shove off!
2120017376/Looking for adventure?
2120017377/The plague kills more and more humans - we hope it continues.
2120017378/Shove off, lest me and the boys hurt ya.
2120017379/If I were Vivaldi, I would do all I could to destroy this city.
2120017380/They come at night, raping and killing. Time for revenge! Sacred dwarven tradition: an eye for an eye!
2120017381/What do you seek here, human?
2120017382/Vivaldi, but I doubt he'll speak with you.
2120017383/Vivaldi detests humans and this city. Believe me, he has reason.
2120017384/If I catch those bastards who attack at night, I'll rip their legs out of their arses.
2120017385/Liquors are my best friend...
2120017386/Shove off, lest me and the boys hurt ya.
2120017387/Begone!
2120017388/Need something?
2120017389/They took it, those sons of bitches. Now I must rent if I want to work.
2120017390/Human come to see a nonhuman? You need something?
2120017391/It's night! Come back in the morning.
2120017392/Malcolm Stein - not a better blacksmith in all Vizima.
2120017393/How the hell do they imagine I'll forge things for humans? I'm a bleeding dwarf! Strange coincidence, too. That character connected with the Order recently acquired new Mahakaman anvils, strangely similar to my own...
2120017394/Come back later.
2120017395/Are you trying to offend me or can't you control what you say? I can, for 50 orens.
2120017396/Zoltan praised you, so we can trade. If you care to buy something, see my apprentice. I do the forging and handle special orders.
2120017397/It's ready - 50 orens.
2120017398/I only serve friends and those who come recommended. I won't have my goods used against nonhumans.
2120017399/I know what one is. We used them in Mahakam when humans still prayed to storms. You haven't learned much about lightning rods since.
2120017400/Come back later.
2120017401/Run, pious doggie!
2120017402/No, worse. Damned city officials. Slapped me with taxes, on running a nonhuman business, trading in nonhuman goods...
2120017403/I learned to kill humans at the Battle of Sodden.
2120017404/Nothing I miss like a good beer.
2120017405/My spine aches and I've got boils. Accursed swamp.
2120017406/What are you looking for?
2120017407/Be careful talking to elves, always eager to fight.
2120017408/In Vizima, I had to pay a nonhuman tax. Nobody tells me what to do 'round here.
2120017409/Talk to Yaevinn 'fore someone kills you for spying.
2120017410/Come back tomorrow.
2120017411/You look odd. Mess with the wrong woman?
2120017412/What is it?
2120017413/Ask the elves.
2120017414/What is it?
2120017415/That human-loving traitor? No one will help you here.
2120017416/Damn monsters! Another scout's disappeared!
2120017417/I shall complain to King Foltest's courtiers once I enter the city.
2120017418/Avoid beggars - they carry the plague.
2120017419/I dislike it here.
2120017420/I shall pray at the Temple of Eternal Fire.
2120017421/I may have heard of your brotherhood.
2120017422/Want to buy something? Rob me in broad daylight, go ahead!
2120017423/What do you want?
2120017424/I'm forced to sell my goods out here.
2120017425/My life!
2120017426/You trading or talking?
2120017427/I dislike those who intrude in others' business.
2120017428/Hands off your sword grip.
2120017429/That's not your concern.
2120017430/Selling something? If not, don't bother me.
2120017431/Cease bothering me.
2120017432/Can I interest you in something?
2120017433/Had a beautiful sable fur and some silverware, but some bastards stole it. Human vileness knows no bounds.
2120017434/Shove off, you rat.
2120017435/King Foltest raised customs duties again. This bodes ill!
2120017436/Damn Squirrels, assaulting convoys like during the war.
2120017437/Accursed plague stopped our transport outside Vizima!
2120017438/None may enter Vizima...
2120017439/Humans and nonhumans both pay the double poll tax. A scandal!
2120017440/My stomach hurts! Cursed witch...Agghh..
2120017441/Murderer!
2120017442/Help!
2120017443/Unforgivable...
2120017444/No need to rush.
2120017445/I should hurry.
2120017446/We're angry.
2120017447/I hate this weather.
2120017448/Useless rain.
2120017449/What a downpour.
2120017450/Some rain.
2120017451/The bank is temporarily closed. Our apologies.
2120017452/I'm busy.
2120017453/How long must I wait?
2120017454/Aaargh.
2120017455/When will Vizima's gates open?
2120017456/This isn't information. We take applications, not foolish questions!
2120017457/Title deed, proof of payment? Know what you can do with those?
2120017458/These documents stink of fraud and you want them approved?
2120017459/Break's coming up.
2120017460/Someone here took a bribe? We don't like tattlers. Shove off!
2120017461/Comma missing, stamp placed wrong... can't accept this application.
2120017462/I've always supported equal rights!
2120017463/This is a mistake...
2120017464/Don't hurt me!
2120017465/I sense Tridam Syndrome.
2120017466/I have a wife and children...
2120017467/Run!
2120017468/Hell with it.
2120017469/Die, sonny.
2120017470/Don't kill me!
2120017471/Die!
2120017472/Stop right there.
2120017473/Damn., Shit.
2120017474/Follow me!
2120017475/You piss me off.
2120017476/Kill the bastard!
2120017477/Boys, finish him off!
2120017478/Nothing doing, witcher.
2120017479/Dog's balls, I don't know what to say...! A while longer and he'd have duped us all. How do you want to finish the son of a bitch off?
2120017480/Spit it out.
2120017481/The bastard lusts after antiques and luxuries - like any savage who makes a coin or two. I was once asked to handle an entire transport of that shit - turned out it was for him.
2120017482/Be glad they all come to me. If Salamandra paid their accounts, the city would've toppled long ago.
2120017483/Then don't fucking ask me. Your witcher boy was working for the alchemist Kalkstein.
2120017484/I can do anything... but I don't feel like it.
2120017485/We'll see.
2120017486/I can do anything. Tell the gravedigger his debt's cleared. He'll piss his pants in gratitude.
2120017487/The great Geralt has spoken. He lectures, plays the wise one, and I couldn’t give a rat's arse.
2120017488/Not being petty, I won't take it personally. All customers lose their wits once in a while.
2120017489/Think of something! Be fucking creative!
2120017490/Talk to the men he's after. They might know.
2120017491/What's your problem?
2120017492/So who am I? Some pious priestess' virginity that she lost in a dark alley?
2120017493/That hurt, Geralt.
2120017494/Except I needed the city guards' help at the time. I tipped Vincent off and they confiscated everything. I've needed even more protection since.
2120017495/Out, freak!
2120017496/Fark off!
2120017497/I'd say so! Goddamn Dijkstra, ace spy. Dog's balls, what a clever analysis.
2120017498/So what'll it be? We doing some plowing business?
2120017499/Fair offer. I bought it from a man at the Hairy Bear tavern.
2120017500/Oh, fuck off!
2120017501/I pay Vincent's halfwits a few coins and they see to my personal safety... I'm done now, see you.
2120017502/I'll be plowed if I know.
2120017503/Would you strut about proudly if you had debts?
2120017504/What a revelation.
2120017505/Dog's balls, I'm a fence. Want me to draw you a picture? You think I ask every thief who he plowed for his goods?
2120017506/Damned dangerous times. I need protection from Salamandra - that's why I deal with the guards.
2120017507/Better believe I fucking will. Even now.
2120017508/Drinking with you's a fucking treat... I'll show you something interesting, though I shouldn't.
2120017509/Shove off, and if you show your face around here again, I'll tell my guard friends to rip three more holes in your arse.
2120017510/If you figure anything out and need more information, creep on over and we'll talk.
2120017511/What'll you give me if I tell you?
2120017512/I have your boyfriend's other property. The sword I got elsewhere.
2120017513/No need, he's the most famous dice player around. Out-fucking-standing, a real goddam magician.
2120017514/I'll let you in on something. I might have gotten on Azar's bad side once...
2120017515/Am I a fence? Un-fucking-believable!
2120017516/I'm an abso-fucking-lutely great poker player. Why?
2120017517/Right...
2120017518/Got balls enough?
2120017519/Man named Coleman.
2120017520/Stubborn-arsed fellow, aren't you? From a middleman.
2120017521/Not now.
2120017522/Well, it wasn't his fucking razor...
2120017523/Both the bastard guards and the arse-loving thieves need me. That's real art, witcher. I have deals with everyone and that makes me untouchable.
2120017524/I underestimated you, witcher.
2120017525/Besides, I'd never survive in this business if I sold hot goods I actually had a hand in getting.
2120017526/What?!
2120017527/Right, meaning not his sword, got it? Like his undershorts that he pissed all over or something.
2120017528/First of all, it's the cocksucking guards. Second, why do you care?
2120017529/A pox on pictures! Berengar's nothing to me! My suppliers might know more...
2120017530/Piss-swilling reptiles, I've heard of 'em but I've no fucking idea what they want.
2120017531/Did you fucking fall off your horse?
2120017532/That concludes your investigation? I'm almost disappointed.
2120017533/That information you get free. I'll charge you the usual for anything else.
2120017534/Heheh... that's confidential. You need to know how to take care of yourself.
2120017535/At the Hairy Bear tavern. Doubt he'd want to talk to you.
2120017536/Get some practice before you fucking bother me again.
2120017537/This damn investigation is getting tiring. Prove me innocent.
2120017538/Don't make me laugh. You're a swiving amateur.
2120017539/I heard White Wolf's a clever man, but you're a fucking moron!
2120017540/I found a book... Redanian Intelligence - A History... Everybody thought this damned scroll had disappeared.
2120017541/Shut the fuck up.
2120017542/Tell me.
2120017543/We aren't all plowing philanderers! Some of us have depth...
2120017544/I'm a fence. I buy and sell.
2120017545/I'm really fucking interested.
2120017546/Everything worthwhile.
2120017547/We'll speak shortly.
2120017548/He has made numerous vows in his life, one of which is to protect the royal family. Sadly, for unknown reasons, Princess Adda holds little respect for him.
2120017549/Erkin has taken a vow of silence and thus, cannot answer. You must be wondering why he is here...
2120017550/Let me introduce my master, the honorable Erkin von Blunt...
2120017551/Vows, however, must be honored, whatever the circumstances.
2120017552/He authorized me to speak on his behalf... and I serve as his advisor.
2120017553/It's a sign of the times. New customs and fashions. You think it better to show the Nilfgaardian we're barbarians? That we can't distinguish between a fork and comb? That the only way we know how to feast is to get blind drunk and roar lusty songs while slapping the serving wenches on their arse...?
2120017554/Enjoying yourself?
2120017555/I need to get Erkin a private meeting with him. At present his intentions are a pure riddle.
2120017556/Next room, box bearing the Temerian emblem... Is that so damned difficult?
2120017557/Geralt...
2120017558/I wouldn't deceive you - I think you're one of us, it's a cause we share. I don't know the enemy yet, but I will soon, and when I do... the Time of the Sword and the Axe will come, blood will flow in the streets. And know this, comrade, there will be no room for your neutrality.
2120017559/Not a bit. Since then, my men have been hunting catoblepas throughout the continent in secret. At market, it costs more than a good whore.
2120017560/Then I'll tell you Adda's favorite dish.
2120017561/Thaler the fence does nothing for free.
2120017562/Catoblepas.
2120017563/I exaggerate. A goat would be just as good...
2120017564/Salamandra has a patron, someone in this room or one known here. You're up to your ears in this, Wolf, whether you like it or not.
2120017565/I can't deny it. May I ask a personal question? The amphibians you're after, are they a personal matter or an ideological one?
2120017566/Care to explain?
2120017567/Care to explain?
2120017568/This game concerns you more than you imagine. You mean to tell me you're not interested in the conflict between the Order and the Scoia'tael? You mean to tell me you don't care? What about your lover, Triss Merigold?
2120017569/Care to explain?
2120017570/I'm a patriot. I've the good of the kingdom at heart. A kingdom threatened by the schemes and alliances you were observant enough to note...
2120017571/Give me a minute, I need to get a bite...
2120017572/I suppose you know her better than I, but don't say I didn't warn you. Regarding Leuvaarden, we know he heads some transnational organization of merchants, bankers and other wealthy folk. Make what you will of it...
2120017573/How'd it go?
2120017574/You'd make a fine agent.
2120017575/Got it. Thank you for being candid.
2120017576/Our princess has some weaknesses, but stupidity is not one of them.
2120017577/Temerian intelligence. I execute the king's direct orders. I find traitors, rats and foreign agents. I'm a spy.
2120017578/Some time ago this maniac, who looked a lot like you, arrived in Vizima claiming that nothing surpasses finely prepared catoblepas meat.
2120017579/That Nilfgaardian dog is a mere pawn. I cannot fathom why Adda tolerates him.
2120017580/Your, uh, "friend" seems to get along famously with Leuvaarden. For two strangers, they certainly have much to discuss. See for yourself.
2120017581/Then she should choose better allies. Unlike chess, this game claims lives. I'm afraid someone might be using her.
2120017582/That's the burgomeister's business. I smuggle in catoblepas, but I wouldn't know how to cook it.
2120017583/Really?
2120017584/We have to know shit like that - as special agents, people of the shadows...
2120017585/Thaler does nothing for free... Go to the next room and fetch the letter from the box with the Temerian coat of arms. Be discrete.
2120017586/Have it your way. Let me tell you, friend - a serious slashfest is in the works, one without pardon. The defeated will be picked apart by crows. You'll be forced to fight for a new order, comrade - or against it. We will fight for our traditions and customs, for our land and our women.
2120017587/Like most knights of the Order, he worries his dick's too small, so he gets aggressive whenever something scares him. Then, of course, he's a Nilfgaardian.
2120017588/He's involved! The counterfeit royal edicts!
2120017589/You lie, De Wett. I can prove it and you'll hang...
2120017590/Non possumus!
2120017591/Clearly! If this is a royal edict, where's Foltest's signature? Geralt, this is a provocation!
2120017592/Come see me, Geralt. I've something to tell you.
2120017593/Good idea. But I must speak with you...
2120017594/Quiet, priest!
2120017595/Where'd you get the royal seal, you ball-licking bastard?!
2120017596/Thanks for your help, Geralt...
2120017597/Made your decision?
2120017598/Foltest would have you hanged!
2120017599/Fine, meet me at the New Narakort.
2120017600/Never! You won't take me alive, you bastards!
2120017601/Geralt, don't listen to that piss-swilling cheat!
2120017602/Then I must defend myself!
2120017603/My sources tell me this edict is fake!
2120017604/Does it matter, witcher?
2120017605/I suppose I should thank you for saving my ass.
2120017606/There's something afoot...
2120017607/We meet again, witcher.
2120017608/It's like this. Before the King departed, he placed Vizima in my care. See?
2120017609/Having problems, witcher?
2120017610/Exactly.
2120017611/Sadly, my code of conduct forbids me from using my position for private benefit.
2120017612/I'm glad.
2120017613/Not your business, witcher.
2120017614/Of course it was, provided you have Temeria's well-being at heart.
2120017615/A seal can be stolen, but a signature is difficult to forge.
2120017616/I know you can read, witcher. But notice both the king's seal... and his signature.
2120017617/Damn lies! The edict is a fake! This dickless, brainless, sell-out zealot burns to see me eliminated...
2120017618/This area looks worse than I imagined.
2120017619/What a mess.
2120017620/It stinks of nonhumans here.
2120017621/I detest this place.
2120017622/This was once a beautiful quarter.
2120017623/Nonhumans have gone too far, but Foltest will settle them.
2120017624/The Order thinks it owns Vizima!
2120017625/We must prevent humans and nonhumans from lunging at each other's throats.
2120017626/Foltest may take on both nonhumans and the Order.
2120017627/What have they done to this city?
2120017628/Humans and nonhumans alike, dead 'neath the ruins.
2120017629/Velerad will turn red when he sees this quarter.
2120017630/We could barely separate the knights and the nonhumans.
2120017631/Witcher Geralt! They say you're one of us.
2120017632/I'd rather be in bed, but duty calls.
2120017633/Master?
2120017634/Master Geralt! The she-beast is murdering people!
2120017635/Master! Are you a witcher?
2120017636/The striga appeared by the tower! I was sent to get a witcher. Already five soldiers have breathed their last! Help us!
2120017637/What's to say? She's the most striga-like striga there is.
2120017638/Truthfully, no...
2120017639/The tallest in the district. The one the Scoia'tael set ablaze.
2120017640/We must hurry!
2120017641/Our orders are to protect this quarter.
2120017642/Argh.
2120017643/Expect no sympathy!
2120017644/Ready for a thrashing?
2120017645/Ah, dull.
2120017646/Sorry yet?
2120017647/I feel lusty.
2120017648/What?
2120017649/What do you want?
2120017650/You jest?
2120017651/Pull back! That's an order!
2120017652/Ugh.
2120017653/At them!
2120017654/I beg mercy!
2120017655/I'll break your bones.
2120017656/No entry, blockhead.
2120017657/Ahem.
2120017658/Attack!
2120017659/Everyone follow me!
2120017660/You will die!
2120017661/Hm.
2120017662/Attack!
2120017663/What might that mean?
2120017664/My feet hurt.
2120017665/Please, mercy!
2120017666/Fall back!
2120017667/I'll break your bones.
2120017668/Not a step closer.
2120017669/Duty calls.
2120017670/Follow me!
2120017671/You die!
2120017672/Stop him!
2120017673/Get them!
2120017674/Wouldna mind a drink.
2120017675/Attack!
2120017676/What does that mean?
2120017677/Jethro, keep it down! You looking to kill me?
2120017678/Stop screaming or on my mother's life I'll bloody smash your junkie mouth!
2120017679/NOT_USED
2120017680/You die!
2120017681/Stop him!
2120017682/Get them!
2120017683/Attack!
2120017684/Begone!
2120017685/Looking for something?
2120017686/I know we needed a witcher to kill the sewer beast... but the Butcher of Blaviken?
2120017687/I know who you are. The city guards are watching you. I'll hear of no humans being slain in this town.
2120017688/My captain forbade me to talk to you.
2120017689/Witty... What you want?
2120017690/There's one tavern, three gates, a market, a hospital and dark alleys you'd best avoid.
2120017691/"The Hairy Bear" - a true cesspit, with dodgy clientele. Better to drink from a trough.
2120017692/The streets are dangerous at night - go home.
2120017693/One leads to the dike, another to the castle and the third to the merchants' quarter.
2120017694/You cannot use the Merchants' and Castle gates without a permit. The king has instituted a quarantine.
2120017695/They're by the Castle Gate.
2120017696/It reeks of the plague. They treat the diseased, burning the rags they use. Anyone who gets on our bad side gets stationed there, heheh.
2120017697/...get out of here, witcher!
2120017698/We cannot speak further. Captain's orders.

2120017709/We want no trouble.
2120017710/The state of emergency means we're watching types like you.
2120017711/A monster annihilated a pharmacist and his apprentice at the Merchants' Gate.
2120017712/What?
2120017713/They've rushed us out without thought of our pay.
2120017714/The bandits grow bolder.
2120017715/Shove off!
2120017716/Curfew! Beware of monsters.
2120017717/They told me to watch for those with the Salamander badge.
2120017718/Those dogs were dealing in death.
2120017719/Good work. Go talk to Jethro outside.
2120017720/Good work. Jethro waits for you up there.
2120017721/Make way for the Temerian Militia!
2120017722/No loitering.
2120017723/We have no time to talk.
2120017724/We keep things shipshape.
2120017725/Martial law is in effect.
2120017726/Enough excuses. Your devilish magic will not work on us! For Vincent! Grab him!
2120017727/When he saw the body, our medic claimed the wounds were caused by a scythe, its blade facing upwards.
2120017728/Geralt of Rivia! You are under arrest for the murder of Captain Vincent!
2120017729/Temeria fights on!
2120017730/Don't kill me!
2120017731/Retreat in formation!
2120017732/Stop or I'll pepper you with bolts.
2120017733/Argh, serving the crown.
2120017734/Everyone follow me! Follow me!
2120017735/Enemy in sight!
2120017736/To the last drop of blood!
2120017737/Enemy in sight!
2120017738/Death to the bastards!
2120017739/I don't find that amusing.
2120017740/Gates closed until further notice! Quarantine in effect!
2120017741/Mikul admits monks and folk with passes.
2120017742/No passage. If you have a letter, find Mikul.
2120017743/Halt, in the name of King Foltest! Master Geralt... didn't recognize you.
2120017744/The knights of the Order prepare to attack.
2120017745/We'll defend this quarter, whatever the cost.
2120017746/Run!
2120017747/Argh, you...
2120017748/Yaa, you'll be sorry!
2120017749/No, please!
2120017750/Don't move!
2120017751/Look lively.
2120017752/Get him!
2120017753/Walk carefully, witcher.
2120017754/I remain vigilant.
2120017755/Onward, follow me!
2120017756/My boys are watching you.
2120017757/Earn your pay!
2120017758/Seize them!
2120017759/Waste of words.
2120017760/You only live once!
2120017761/You jest?
2120017762/I'm sleepy.
2120017763/For the gold they pay you!
2120017764/I wanna live!
2120017765/Fall back!
2120017766/You son-of-a...
2120017767/You're not allowed!
2120017768/Not enough pay for this.
2120017769/Everyone follow me!
2120017770/Get him!
2120017771/Attack!
2120017772/Oh, you bastard!
2120017773/Wasting my time.
2120017774/If that's a knight of the Order, then I'm Princess Adda!
2120017775/A blasphemer and counterfeiter, do I guess well?
2120017776/Who do we have here, Mikul? Is this the man we want?
2120017777/It's the Grand Master!
2120017778/We're saved!
2120017779/You'll lose half your gold...
2120017780/It's that white-haired fellow. He's spotted us!
2120017781/No passage! The captain forbids it.
2120017782/Captain's orders. Talk to him.
2120017783/A hero? Well that changes things.
2120017784/In that case, please pass, master Geralt. We'll drink your health at the inn.
2120017785/He's passed out. Shove off.
2120017786/Bloody thugs! Ramsmeat sent them!
2120017787/Stay away from the prisoner!
2120017788/No one's allowed to approach the prisoner!
2120017789/Stay away from the prisoner!
2120017790/Shh, return tonight.
2120017791/Not now! Come back at night...
2120017792/Glad we caught them before they managed that weapons shipment. Haren, a true patriot, lost his life luring them into a trap.
2120017793/The same unit that slaughtered villagers near Vizima.
2120017794/Was. He's hanging already. Before dying, he admitted contacting you.
2120017795/We're arresting him for collaborating with terrorists.
2120017796/His nephew was in the very unit the Order captured.
2120017797/Gather your belongings, Vivaldi. You can grieve in the dungeon.
2120017798/Thph!
2120017799/This is dull.
2120017800/Spit it out or captain'll drill us again.
2120017801/I could use a drink...
2120017802/What if it creeps this way?
2120017803/There's a creature creeps from the graveyard...
2120017804/Luckily not on our beat.
2120017805/It'll have its fill on the patrol before it gets here.
2120017806/Time passes faster.
2120017807/Hmhmhmhmm.
2120017808/Humming again?
2120017809/It'll bring us misfortune.
2120017810/I want to go home.
2120017811/If only I felt like doing this as much as I don't.
2120017812/I wager you trained a lot to kill monsters.
2120017813/I train in daytime, on duty at night. What a life...
2120017814/Begone!
2120017815/We cannot speak.
2120017816/Run. Bandits and monsters rule the night.
2120017817/Whew, training kills me...
2120017818/No passage!
2120017819/Shove off, rogue! Come back when you get serious.
2120017820/Fine. You may pass.
2120017821/Captain said to watch you, not let you pass. Understood?
2120017822/Ah, you. Move on, stop blocking the path.
2120017823/No passage!
2120017824/Come back when you're serious, rogue!
2120017825/Diseased patients inside. I'll not have you spreading the pestilence.
2120017826/You, move along.
2120017827/Fine. Move on.
2120017828/With the promotion due me, I need never wander the streets again.
2120017829/Enough pestering. My legs feel like jelly.
2120017830/Yesternight's watch encountered the living dead!
2120017831/Thank the Lords, I'll not work tonight's shift.
2120017832/A few hours and I'll be home with me wifey.
2120017833/I'm watching you - don't step out of line.
2120017834/Damn, think I spotted movement... No time, need to finish my route!
2120017835/Honest folk sleep at night. What are you doing on the streets?
2120017836/They said, join the guard, the wages are fair. Crap!
2120017837/One, two, three!
2120017838/I hate waving this pike around.
2120017839/Attack!
2120017840/Left, right, stab!
2120017841/Wait...! Charge!
2120017842/Duck, step and slash!
2120017843/Ughhh, this is tough...
2120017844/Enough of this.
2120017845/Oofff...
2120017846/For Vincent!
2120017847/All at once!
2120017848/Die, murderer!
2120017849/Now with the forces in the city, we have little to do.
2120017850/The city guards are badly equipped...
2120017851/The knights of the Order took our wine stash again...
2120017852/We're not trained to fight monsters!
2120017853/They enlisted half our guardhouse!
2120017854/Stay back!
2120017855/Situation's under control.
2120017856/Move away!
2120017857/Go home!
2120017858/There's nothing happening...
2120017859/Don't concern yourself. I know you're busy with Yaevinn and his elven friends...
2120017860/You made your choice, Geralt.
2120017861/Geralt...
2120017862/Years ago, when you first removed the curse, you ordered the princess to wear a necklace with an inclusion. Juniper, broom, and hazel branches were to be burned in her chambers.
2120017863/True, but the king has placed me under his... hmmm... protection. Tell me, where's Alvin?
2120017864/She's a striga, Geralt. We both know that curses don't cast themselves...
2120017865/Definitely. In a sense, I'm a political prisoner - I could teleport away, but that would be highly inappropriate. And I still have a few matters to settle here.
2120017866/Geralt. I was worried about you.
2120017867/Yes, someone close to her who knew the secret. Velerad might know something.
2120017868/Legend says the gnomes once made a suit of armor for a witcher named Raven. Light and durable, it didn't constrain movement. If you found the remains of the armor, perhaps it could be built again.
2120017869/I can't tell you... For the time being, my position is tenuous. If you helped Foltest with the striga, maybe you could vouch for me. I could resolve a few things and go free. How about it?
2120017870/Ask me a question.
2120017871/Kalkstein! He's in Old Vizima. He's certainly not short on knowledge and would help you.
2120017872/If I knew, this would be over.
2120017873/I know. I'd like to help you.
2120017874/I said, don't call me that! Alvin might be anywhere. There's no way to locate him. What will you screw up next?
2120017875/Have you heard of gnomic armor?
2120017876/Clearly he has enough power to teleport himself anywhere, perhaps even through time...
2120017877/Frankly, I never guessed he'd bypass the dimeritium. That would be a feat for many sorcerers.
2120017878/Don't call me that! People might mistake us for more than acquaintances, and I cannot be friends with someone who doesn't trust me! While we're at it, where's Alvin?
2120017879/What do you want?
2120017880/You and that incompetent troubadour are like irresponsible and short-sighted children! This would never have happened if Alvin had been with me! But the witcher knew better and does as he pleases.
2120017881/Vanished? That's awful. He might be anywhere in time and space. I had hoped the amulet would block those abilities.
2120017882/I wouldn't dream of boring you with them. I know you're busy slaying nonhumans...
2120017883/We'd sell what we grew to buy copper pots, iron rakes...
2120017884/Geralt, hold me...
2120017885/Geralt...
2120017886/Geralt...
2120017887/Mhm... But I don't want to lose you...
2120017888/Excuse me, quelling a rebellion - is that what they call it? Eliminating terrorists? I see no difference.
2120017889/A house... Nice dream. You could breed horses and sheep, I'd tend to the garden, cook meals...
2120017890/We'd age with dignity. Evenings you'd play bagpipes of your own making, as a remedy for my gloom.
2120017891/I'm here. These are trying times. We just need to survive. We can dream again when the madness passes...
2120017892/You're right...
2120017893/I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... Geralt, say something.
2120017894/I love you, too, Geralt. To the end of time...
2120017895/Ohh, Geralt...
2120017896/Thank you, Geralt.
2120017897/You should try to locate the remaining pieces of this armor, then use them to create a new suit. Start by searching some of the ancient gravesites in the swamp.
2120017898/Geralt, there's no sense staying here. We don't know what Salamandra is planning, you need to enter their base.
2120017899/Geralt...
2120017900/Shall we?
2120017901/I could hardly desert you.
2120017902/I think so, too. So before I left the castle I snatched a key to the crypt. From there, we can enter the catacombs beneath the manor.
2120017903/What was that?
2120017904/Another time. They're coming. Go... I detest tearful good-byes.
2120017905/Since when do I need your permission to cause trouble? Or you mine, for that matter?
2120017906/No, I'll stay here. I've still got strength left, so those mutants are going to taste some fire.
2120017907/Come with me, we'll speak later.
2120017908/Yes, you?
2120017909/Scoia'tael are murdering humans, the Order is slaying nonhumans, and Foltest's soldiers are trying to restore order. So far it's a tie.
2120017910/Oh, lords... But that means...
2120017911/Geralt, you're here!
2120017912/After the striga's death, Foltest grew so gloomy I wouldn't want to be his enemy. Fortunately, we've made an agreement that will limit the number of corpses.
2120017913/Not tragic either, now that you've cured Adda. Like any reasonable monarch, Foltest has approached the Lodge about an alliance. The Lodge will provide the support he needs to retain his throne and restore order...
2120017914/I told you I could handle them. What happened below?
2120017915/I know, Geralt, I know.
2120017916/He's very charismatic with a talent for magic of the "wild" kind.
2120017917/I saw a boat at the dock. Let's meet there.
2120017918/Great. Learn anything about who's behind Salamandra?
2120017919/Like a source, he uses the Power intuitively. He had no mentor and attended no magic academies - I checked. He probably tamed the Power through tremendous discipline, typical of religious sectarians...
2120017920/Hard to say. He shields himself well.
2120017921/Thanks to you, among others. But most importantly, hundreds of lives will be saved.
2120017922/I believe it's time we finalized our agreement, Sire. I will counsel and support you with wise words... and magic.
2120017923/Doubtless with that ambitious pup, Radovid of Redania...
2120017924/Geralt, Foltest should learn of the Grand Master's betrayal. We need to talk to the king.
2120017925/So what's this historic moment, Dandelion?
2120017926/The Order shows its true face.
2120017927/We have to stop him!
2120017928/We'll have to get dirty. The only way to the monastery leads through the sewers.
2120017929/Not since a zeugl made its nest there, a big one...
2120017930/Typical, a mob led by a madman. Again, someone will have to decide for them. This time, it'll be us.
2120017931/He's bet it all, releasing mutated knights against the people. Even the pious Siegfried was duped...
2120017932/I'm right behind you, Geralt.
2120017933/We need to hurry, Geralt.
2120017934/It's somewhere in the sewers. Any advice?
2120017935/Geralt, what would you do without me? Wait here. I'll be back in a blink.
2120017936/Are you sure that's what they want?
2120017937/I should have. Let's go.
2120017938/Almost there. We'll find Jacques de Aldersberg in the monastery.
2120017939/I doubt it found a mate.
2120017940/I'm serious.
2120017941/We need to hurry!
2120017942/How could that madman release his mutated knights into the city?
2120017943/Here we must part.
2120017944/It's more than a dream. Should you die here, your death will be very real.
2120017945/I shall accompany you, assist you. Only a blizzard follows us, with nothing beyond it but death.
2120017946/At the heart of the vision, he controls all. You must go on alone.
2120017947/The unexpected awaits you here.
2120017948/You're stronger than the Grand Master thought. You summoned me.
2120017949/The Grand Master invited you into a vision of the future enclosed in his mind. Yet you brought your own visions and specters.
2120017950/Good luck, Geralt.
2120017951/You'll reach him soon. Don't give up.
2120017952/Look! Alvin!
2120017953/I'll stop Savolla. The mantis is your job.
2120017954/I don't know. I blocked him, though he tried to scramble the link - not an easy feat....
2120017955/Savolla tried contacting him telepathically, but I cut him off...
2120017956/Unlikely. Geralt, please don't challenge him...
2120017957/Someone powerful, capably disguised, helped Savolla. Without that, I would have conquered his defenses in the Lower Courtyard.
2120017958/Not now, Geralt...
2120017959/We'll talk once it's safe.
2120017960/Hard to say. I know neither him nor his specialty, and I don't like the situation.
2120017961/NOT_USED
2120017962/NOT_USED
2120017963/NOT_USED

2120017966/NOT_USED
2120017967/Geralt! Open the gate! Quick!!!
2120017968/The gate!
2120017969/Zirana wheeeza onota de'eap ta!
2120017970/Veas caer mohor'tea orya vea.
2120017971/Damn, he's blocking me!
2120017972/NOT_USED
2120017973/NOT_USED
2120017974/NOT_USED
2120017975/A bluff. He's exhausted from teleporation... Magic lights is about all he can muster.
2120017976/I'll figure something out.
2120017977/I'll try.
2120017978/The Professor is wanted in Redania, Temeria and Kaedwen. A real maggot...
2120017979/I don't recognize the sorcerer...
2120017980/Only I can break the barrier. I'm going inside.
2120017981/I'm going, then.
2120017982/Vesemir, if that idiot doesn't shut it, I'll...
2120017983/Savolla just cast a spell! Something's happening!
2120017984/That's nice, Eskel, but I'm teleporting to your lab. Savolla is mentally connected to the other mage. I'll use him as a beacon and I could 'lose' you along the way...
2120017985/I said I didn't know him. I think we should protect the lab above all...
2120017986/I'm a big girl, I'll manage.
2120017987/The plague, you're all children! Why didn't you mention the Circle?!
2120017988/Savolla just cast a spell! Something's happening!
2120017989/If the mage aligned with the Circle, he can create a stable portal through which he'll travel to anywhere on the continent, taking your equipment with him...
2120017990/NOT_USED
2120017991/Quick, to the lab!
2120017992/It's so beautiful here... I'm feeling stronger.
2120017993/Thank you. As for the mutagens... their loss could prove catastrophic.
2120017994/I'd have to examine you. There's a good chance your memory will return on its own.
2120017995/That's difficult to say. It might help if I knew what caused you to lose your memory.
2120017996/No matter... I have something I'd like to teach you.
2120017997/I guess I disappointed you all... Forgive me.
2120017998/I missed you so... Let's see if the "best bed in Kaer Morhen" can hold us...
2120017999/He's very powerful. He completely controlled the energy he drew from the Circle. We may soon be facing another Vilgefortz...
2120018000/Only a master of the arcane arts can use that knowledge. Not many of those left...
2120018001/Well, you have something to look forward to, then. No matter. Tell me, how did the battle end?
2120018002/You don't remember anything?
2120018003/Uuuuuhh....
2120018004/Poor Vesemir. Another protege dead prematurely.
2120018005/Geralt, can we go?
2120018006/Most sorcerers and rulers would sell their greedy, power-hungry souls to get the mutagens.
2120018007/Let's not lose any more time... Unless there's something you'd like to ask me.
2120018008/Come on, then.
2120018009/Oh...
2120018010/Yes...
2120018011/Perhaps... Anything's possible, but speculating wastes time. We just don't have enough information.
2120018012/Thank you, Geralt.
2120018013/Meet me outside.
2120018014/That was terrible. I dreamt Lambert was with me...
2120018015/I'm so glad to see you. What?
2120018016/I need some air, I can still hear Lambert barking... I'll speak with Vesemir and wait for you. Will you come to see me?
2120018017/I'm so happy you're... back. When I saw you, all the feelings I tried to deny returned, stronger than ever...
2120018018/Of course... I shouldn't pressure you. I just feel so... The powers! I'm behaving like a teenager! Let's focus on the present...
2120018019/Oh, Geralt, a pleasure. As always...
2120018020/He was staring at me, saying things like "Don't go dying on me, Merigold," calling me bigheaded.
2120018021/You're right. Give me a minute to pack.
2120018022/I know we should set out, but I have a feeling we won't be back, perhaps ever. Won't you stay just a bit longer, with me?
2120018023/It restores endurance, very useful when fighting mages...
2120018024/Drink the potion!
2120018025/We can't afford to lose any more time...
2120018026/This could be a hard fight, Geralt... Take this potion. Witchers call it the Tawny Owl.
2120018027/Uh... argh...
2120018028/Hurry! Open the gate!
2120018029/Hurry, Geralt! We can't hold them much longer!
2120018030/Ordinary bandits would never attack Kaer Morhen.
2120018031/In due time, Lambert...
2120018032/Lambert and Eskel were supposed to fix them yesterday...
2120018033/Face the truth, witchers. They're here to rob you.
2120018034/And you can't let the bandits in the lab!
2120018035/I mean the laboratory and you know it. Someone wants your famed mutagens...
2120018036/What ungodly beast is that from? No matter.
2120018037/You had this coming.
2120018038/Don't do that!
2120018039/You just pissed off a sorceress!
2120018040/Geralt, finally!
2120018041/Geralt.
2120018042/I'll teach him to respect a sorceress.
2120018043/If they want a fight, I'll give them one.
2120018044/I almost feel sorry for you.
2120018045/Not quite appropriate, wouldn't you say?
2120018046/I don't know what you meant by that and I'd rather not guess.
2120018047/Stop!
2120018048/Stop, I said!
2120018049/Geralt, take that away.
2120018050/Should you be up? I'd rather make sure you've recovered completely.
2120018051/Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit.
2120018052/Men can do nothing but talk and then always claim the initiative.
2120018053/I should be able to convince him.
2120018054/I know.
2120018055/You're mistaken. I have him under control.
2120018056/And not just him. They're all eating out of my hand. I regret that Foltest is away at the summit, but I trust you'll tend to the kings' council.
2120018057/I must get back. I'll contact you when it's all over.
2120018058/Yes, I made an offer and he accepted. He claims his superiors had similar plans but we beat them to it.
2120018059/You wish, witcher.
2120018060/NOT_USED
2120018061/Time flows slowly at Kaer Morhen.
2120018062/Geralt, we... Oh!
2120018063/Barely two days have passed since they found you...
2120018064/Remember anything?
2120018065/Savolla, I know him. A mage - as ambitious as he is insane...
2120018066/I sense magic... There's a sorcerer among them.
2120018067/The one in glasses is the Professor. Murder for hire...
2120018068/They're breaking through.
2120018069/They're breaking through.
2120018070/Quickly! Defend the laboratory!
2120018071/They're ransacking the laboratory... The other mage is... I underestimated him... Hurry...
2120018072/I'll try to use my influence to find the bandits. If I learn anything, I'll contact Geralt.
2120018073/Don't get killed, Geralt. I don't think I could deal with that again. I'll see you soon.
2120018074/Don't, Geralt. I detest goodbyes. I'm liable to cry and there's nothing more pathetic than a sorceress in tears.
2120018075/I'll gather what information I can and find you in Vizima.
2120018076/Geralt, I urge you to change your tone. Listen to what Declan has to say.
2120018077/I think you had a reason, but you need to figure out what it was. I can't help you there.
2120018078/I do. And that Geralt I like.
2120018079/You never broached the subject directly. I guess the amnesia removed certain barriers. You're more open. I suppose that's progress.
2120018080/Unfortunately. Though I admit there were times when you followed your heart.
2120018081/Ha, embarrassed? We don't have to talk about it anymore. Just remember to think your decisions through.
2120018082/Well, that won't tell us anything about your amnesia. Hopefully we'll learn more in the future.
2120018083/All right, but be quick.
2120018084/Well... You seem to be at full strength. It must be that unusual witcher's metabolism.
2120018085/By some miracle... I decided to look for Salamandra using unconventional methods.
2120018086/Very good ones. You'll learn it all in due time.
2120018087/To get this information, I had to agree not to tell you.
2120018088/Only the quarter's residents are allowed to move about. I have a house here, so I was able to get a pass.
2120018089/Geralt... you should know we've angered some powerful people. This meeting... could change much.
2120018090/You've forgotten everything... He must have immense powers. Elder Blood must course through his veins.
2120018091/Patience, we're on the right path.
2120018092/It's a beautiful ring...
2120018093/Sure you're not spoiling Alvin? I don't want him getting fussy...
2120018094/Well, I'd like you to spend more time with Alvin. The boy needs some discipline.
2120018095/I'm not jealous, I'd just like to know where we are...
2120018096/It allows conversations over short distances. With some knowledge of magic, one can draw quite a bit of information from it. If the Salamanders were using it to communicate with their base, I should be able to pinpoint its location...
2120018097/Well, I registered you as residing here.
2120018098/I knew I could count on you. Is Shani clear about this? No? Then go tell her the boy stays with me. End it.
2120018099/Six this evening. Here's the pass that makes you official in the Trade Quarter.
2120018100/Falsely, of course.
2120018101/Long story... When you men went chasing around...
2120018102/I don't know how to talk to her. She's your friend, settle it with her. I'd be grateful... One more thing - children of elder blood attract creatures from the beyond - ghosts and specters. You might find this scroll useful.
2120018103/Think and talk about your decisions. This just might be the right path to restoring your memory.
2120018104/How noble of you. And what of the famous witcher's neutrality? You're drowning in your sense of decency, though it always gets you in trouble. If you could only remember how many times you've been driven by your heart, what you believed was right - you wouldn't be surprised by your choice.
2120018105/All right. But be careful.
2120018106/You haven't changed, Geralt. Still bothered by your solitude and the derision you face, though you rarely admit that. I don't know if you've chosen well, but the Geralt I knew would've done the same.
2120018107/On instinct?
2120018108/Speak. Then get out of my sight.
2120018109/The communicator sent a signal to a house in Vizima... it's marked on your map. Is there something I should know?
2120018110/Tend to any unfinished business in Vizima. And prepare. Afterwards, it may be too late.
2120018111/I'll inform the interested parties.
2120018112/Geralt, you reek and have woken all the neighbors! What kind of a role model are you?
2120018113/Pure coincidence. I was scanning for magic anomalies and happened upon a false trail set by Kalkstein.
2120018114/I'm glad that's settled... Alvin needs someone who knows magic.
2120018115/The Gift of Lara. We must rein in Alvin's destructive abilities. Hurry, fetch him from the hospital.
2120018116/A boy named Alvin at St. Lebioda's Hospital.
2120018117/Always eager to please.
2120018118/You need to take a stand on the world's problems. It doesn't matter what position, just that you choose one. A strong identity may help restore your memory.
2120018119/Exactly. Your memory should return in due course.
2120018120/Recover you memory? I doubt anyone can. But there's a small chance...
2120018121/From what I saw, I think you would benefit by creating a stable personality.
2120018122/It couldn't help it. Your thoughts were quite loud... In any case, I know about your recent adventures...
2120018123/Important people will attend.
2120018124/Fine, but we need to make sure Alvin's no longer in danger.
2120018125/Yes, I'd appreciate it if you could help me figure them out. But back to your health...
2120018126/Geralt...
2120018127/You're sweet, you know? The only one I trust. You've endured a lot. Time for a reward. The little one's asleep, so let me show you some real magic...
2120018128/I don't know. The alchemist is still there, examing solid stone, but he won't find anything. The greater anomalies are here in Vizima.
2120018129/You misunderstood me. Physically, nothing's wrong. It's your mind that worries me...
2120018130/Well... in addition to a quarantine, the authorities in Vizima have imposed martial law.
2120018131/You raved for hours. I had no choice but to read your thoughts to learn about your injuries and which poisons you took this time.
2120018132/Geralt, I wanted to talk to you about the future, about us...
2120018133/Not readily. Your friend Shani refuses to hand him over. She has no idea what the entire city faces if he spins out of control.
2120018134/Hm, I saw a perfect wall cavity in the Trade Quarter near Town Hall. Place one there, a second in the Temple Quarter near the entrance to the sewers, and the third in Vizima's cemetery.
2120018135/I'm a sorceress, remember? And you think so loud I can't help reading your mind.
2120018136/Various things can cause them, but more importantly they can be the cause of true evil.
2120018137/When I last felt this way, you and a sorceress were trying to capture a genie, destroyed half a city in the process. You probably have no recollection, but a lot hung in the balance.
2120018138/I could use your help. I have some magic sensors that need to be placed around Vizima. They'll help us locate the anomaly's source.
2120018139/Interesting. Why help the Order? What drove you to do that?
2120018140/I'll be there...
2120018141/See you... Oh! I nearly forgot...
2120018142/You're so good with Alvin.
2120018143/Do you have any idea what you've done?! You've sold out the city for a redhead. Get out of here before I turn you into the pig you are.
2120018144/I know. As soon as you did, I scanned all of Vizima and found the source of the anomaly.
2120018145/We'll create a typical Radcliff triangle. You know, of course, that triangulation is most effective in these cases.
2120018146/No. I don't want you turning into my vision of Geralt. I want you to decide for yourself who you are - without looking back.
2120018147/Geralt, please, this is important.
2120018148/Including Princess Adda, whose curse you lifted. Apparently, she's slightly obsessed with you...
2120018149/Leuvaarden, a merchant, wants to see you. He hosts banquets at the New Narakort.
2120018150/It only covers the Trade Quarter, which you haven't entered.
2120018151/Geralt, before we pursue Salamandra, I need to figure out these magic anomalies.
2120018152/Honey... you could spend some time with Alvin. He needs a father...
2120018153/Quiet... Alvin's asleep...
2120018154/You heard me? Ah... Sorceress business. Nothing important.
2120018155/Come to the banquet. If you like, we'll talk there.
2120018156/Patience, witcher.
2120018157/Great. In time for our meeting with Leuvaarden. We'll discuss it with him.
2120018158/Mhm?
2120018159/Love... you know... makes me think of blood coarsing madly, crimson red... rubies?
2120018160/So you love me and have forgotten her?
2120018161/I could, but I don't want to. If you give me a ring, I'll treat it as a pledge. If you don't... I'll try to understand. See you, witcher.
2120018162/I had to make a few promises to learn about Salamandra.
2120018163/Trust me. It was nothing important.
2120018164/Incredible... they're actually signed. Thaler lied... though these signatures do seem forged.
2120018165/And therein lies the voice of reason. Hysterics and madmen who led youths to certain death always angered you. I'm not surprised you chose the Order.
2120018166/The obsession with humanity and a witcher's calling. I should've known.
2120018167/Yes. Dandelion brought him here and explained.
2120018168/I'll send them to an expert. We'll have to be patient...
2120018169/Dandelion told me. Why is Alvin with Shani?
2120018170/Please think about it, Geralt... We needn't talk, a symbolic gift would do, say a ring...
2120018171/Interesting. Why did you decide to help the nonhumans?
2120018172/Progress already?
2120018173/Geralt, it's a telecommunicator... It leaves a magical trace of any transfers...
2120018174/With a bit of luck, we can use this to find the Salamandra base.
2120018175/We'll talk to Leuvaarden about it.
2120018176/Interesting... let me see...
2120018177/And therein lies the voice of reason. Hysterics and madmen who led youths to certain death always angered you. I'm not surprised you chose the Order.
2120018178/The obsession with humanity and a witcher's calling. I should've known.
2120018179/Any progress?
2120018180/Witcher...
2120018181/Geralt, I spoke with Declan.
2120018182/On instinct?
2120018183/Interesting. Why did you decide to help the nonhumans?
2120018184/I do. And that Geralt I like.
2120018185/A long, complex story, but I'll keep it short.
2120018186/Not readily. Your friend Shani refuses to hand him over. She has no idea what the entire city faces if he spins out of control.
2120018187/I need some time to myself. Come back later.
2120018188/Think and talk about your decisions. This just might be the right path to restoring your memory.
2120018189/You never broached the subject directly. I guess the amnesia removed certain barriers. You're more open. I suppose that's progress.
2120018190/You've forgotten everything... He must have immense powers. Elder Blood must course through his veins.
2120018191/How noble of you. And what of the famous witcher's neutrality? You're drowning in your sense of decency, though it always gets you in trouble. If you could only remember how many times you've been driven by your heart, what you believed was right - you wouldn't be surprised by your choice.
2120018192/Ha, embarrassed? We don't have to talk about it anymore. Just remember to think your decisions through.
2120018193/Well, that won't tell us anything about your amnesia. Hopefully we'll learn more in the future.
2120018194/I'm glad you're here. I've learned a lot about Salamandra.
2120018195/Let's talk later. I need to consult with Declan.
2120018196/Their influence has spread further than we thought. We're no longer able to face them ourselves.
2120018197/Declan will make you... an offer.
2120018198/Interesting... let me see...
2120018199/A boy named Alvin at St. Lebioda's Hospital.
2120018200/Geralt, it's a telecommunicator... It leaves a magical trace of any transfers...
2120018201/The two of you should talk.
2120018202/I know. As soon as you did, I scanned all of Vizima and found the source of the anomaly.
2120018203/Don't be so quick to judge... He'll make you an offer - one I think you should accept.
2120018204/I don't know how to talk to her. She's your friend, settle it with her. I'd be grateful...
2120018205/One more thing - elder blood attracts creatures from the beyond - ghosts and specters. You might find this scroll useful.
2120018206/The Gift of Lara. We need to rein in Alvin's destructive abilities. Hurry, fetch him from the hospital.
2120018207/With a bit of luck, we can use this to find the Salamandra base.
2120018208/At home, Geralt. At home.
2120018209/Anything more interesting in mind?
2120018210/I need to speak with Leuvaarden. We'll talk later.
2120018211/Only in bed, witcher, only in bed...
2120018212/You haven't changed, Geralt. Still bothered by your solitude and the derision you face, though you rarely admit that. I don't know if you've chosen well, but the Geralt I knew would've done the same.
2120018213/Unfortunately. Though I admit there were times when you followed your heart.
2120018214/Lara Dorren Aep Shiadhal was no normal elf. More like a genetic bomb. She was to couple with another genetically special individual and bear an even more exceptional child.
2120018215/Not now, darling, the walls have ears. We'll talk at home.
2120018216/But that never happened. Lara fell in love with Cregennan of Lod, a mage, a human. Lara and Cregennan's children, known as those of Elder Blood, proved hard to follow. Thus the sorcerers who had hatched the plan lost control of their precious gene.
2120018217/Interesting. Why help the Order? What drove you to do that?
2120018218/I think you had a reason, but you need to figure out what it was. I can't help you there.
2120018219/Patience, we're on the right path.
2120018220/We thank you for your invitation.
2120018221/Geralt, have you met Thaler?
2120018222/Of course. We shan't be bothering you. Come, Geralt.
2120018223/Smile, witcher. This won't take long.
2120018224/I'd be careful. I have the distinct impression she's got her eye on you.
2120018225/Something nasty lurks behind that innocent face.
2120018226/The minx didn't even acknowledge my presence.
2120018227/Later, Geralt. C'mon, this isn't so bad. Let's mingle.
2120018228/Here we are. Wipe that frown off your face. You'll be fine.
2120018229/Catoblepas steak, rare, for the princess.
2120018230/I'll be with you shortly. Give us a moment, please.
2120018231/Are you kidding?
2120018232/Geralt...
2120018233/Don't be fooled. Anything you say may have political ramifications...
2120018234/I need to speak with Leuvaarden. You behave yourself. Beware of anyone who tries to pry information from you...
2120018235/I'll do better myself.
2120018236/What's important?
2120018237/Sorcery at parties is considered very unseemly...
2120018238/Really?
2120018239/You've met everyone who's anyone...
2120018240/Excuse me, Geralt, I must speak with Leuvaarden.
2120018241/You know I can conjure up orgasms, too?
2120018242/Velerad is King Foltest's right hand...
2120018243/Geralt, allow me to introduce Burgomeister Velerad.
2120018244/Excuse us, Burgomeister, but we need to say hello to the other guests.
2120018245/This could mean trouble.
2120018246/Geralt will be here soon.
2120018247/I'm sensing a disturbance in the Power.
2120018248/It's De Wett!
2120018249/He's right, Geralt. This may be our only chance... Alk'h imbagha, harr'a...!
2120018250/Dar'kh ambra der' ha DREAN!
2120018251/We were waiting.
2120018252/We'll deal with those conditions later. Everything's ready.
2120018253/This may be our only chance... Alk'h imbagha, harr'a...!
2120018254/Dar'kh ambra der' ha DREAN!
2120018255/I was worried...
2120018256/Misunderstandings do arise between different members of the Order... But I take it we're clear about what we're doing...
2120018257/Kill them!
2120018258/Honor?! A second ago the six of you wanted to attack one woman. You wouldn't know honor if it kicked you in the arse!
2120018259/Just in time, Gwynbleidd. The fun is about to start.
2120018260/Thank you, witcher, you saved my life. Come, I know a quiet place where we can talk.
2120018261/It's not far now.
2120018262/Come, Geralt.
2120018263/Oh, what the hell. Strip.
2120018264/What does it matter?
2120018265/You think I... Unbelievable! You think I would-? In these circumstances?! The fate of the world hangs in the balance and you're thinking about sex?!
2120018266/Today I wish to be with you.
2120018267/Are you asking if we're lovers?
2120018268/I realized I couldn't run away from war. Yaevinn is a good leader, strong, charismatic. This is our chance to change history. How could I run away from that?
2120018269/Finally, a breather. I was sure we would meet again.
2120018270/What is it? Why do you gaze at me so?
2120018271/It's time.
2120018272/I feel so much better.
2120018273/True, but I could hardly leave my brethren alone alone to die. I just couldn't.
2120018274/I thought I would find peace far away from the city. After the knights attacked, I realized there was no place I could go to get away. Ultimately, they will show up everywhere. In Vizima we stand a chance of changing that.
2120018275/Surrender, you don't stand a chance!
2120018276/Death awaits you, White Wolf!
2120018277/Lead.
2120018278/Each does as destiny ordains. Before you proceed on the dangerous path before you, accept this gift.
2120018279/What would you say about me? I wanted peace, yet war proved my fate.
2120018280/You killed them though they were not guilty. They did not wish to die of the cold, nor to live on as specters. No one gave them a choice.
2120018281/None of us choose the path we must follow.
2120018282/And I shall choose to fight again, accompanying you now, if only for a moment.
2120018283/Wouldn't want to fight that beast.
2120018284/Freedom in death!
2120018285/Stop!
2120018286/Freedom!
2120018287/Gwynbleidd?
2120018288/Geralt of Rivia.
2120018289/Onward, Children of the Sun! Into the breach!
2120018290/Attack! Victory is ours!
2120018291/Take the bloody path to freedom!
2120018292/Come on, witcher, what was that supposed to mean?
2120018293/The little one has come to love you as a son loves a father. We do not kill children. Take him with you.
2120018294/I'm glad to see you... Listen, Yaevinn is planning something...
2120018295/Aelirenn!
2120018296/We must break through!
2120018297/Naevdetolk!
2120018298/We'll mount a frontal attack... Distract them... He'll stand a chance then...
2120018299/Yaevinn needs our help!
2120018300/Gwynbleidd, use a Sign!
2120018301/Greetings, Geralt.
2120018302/No matter. I am called Toruviel and I am pleased to find you again.
2120018303/What brings you here?
2120018304/Meeting you changed me. I once hated humans without exception. Your words planted doubt... When the war brought all that hatred... I realized there was another way.
2120018305/Greedy dh'oine. Thank you.
2120018306/Indeed. We're wounded and hungry. Negotiations with the peasants went poorly. Our dignity is all we have left...
2120018307/As am I, witcher.
2120018308/Siralin aen parlje, dormaen't.
2120018309/Five.
2120018310/We need food, hurry!
2120018311/I thank you. Moments like these make me think we can end this spiral of hatred and accept each other as we are.
2120018312/You could buy fresh bread. Twenty orens should cover five loaves.
2120018313/I'm pleased we didn't misplace our trust.
2120018314/Have you forgotten me? Much time has passed since our encounter at the end of the world...
2120018315/Yes?
2120018316/In Dol Blathanna, the Valley of the Flowers... a most beautiful place. I granted Dandelion the lute he now plays.
2120018317/Geralt? Why have you come?
2120018318/No.
2120018319/You take me for a fool, witcher? White Rayla exacts only one punishment - death. The unit from Vizima spoke of you. Why should I trust you...?
2120018320/Stand ready!
2120018321/I know you're a friend. Some Scoia'tael from Vizima joined us recently. They spoke of you, of how you helped Yaevinn at the bank. The hav'caaren are once again supplying arms and provisions, for they believe Yaevinn will pay them...
2120018322/Help us flee under the cover of night. We have no wish to fight. With luck, no one will be harmed.
2120018323/I shall release no one. Try any of your tricks and these dh'oine will die. And tell that singer to cease lurking behind the house before someone puts an arrow in his arse...
2120018324/There will be no massacre if they let us depart.
2120018325/And tell Dandelion he may well get shot if he continues to hide behind the house...
2120018326/In faith, I could not. White Rayla stands on that shore. Several peasant corpses have made no impression on her. The children halted her advance.
2120018327/Yes?
2120018328/Bloeggul'ghar. Ogha'daa gluglur.
2120018329/Great sadness, no peace in house.
2120018330/Leoaeool, be what?
2120018331/Yet Dagon must disloved be...
2120018332/Dagon dry, very dry. We love you like water. Humans grieve for bigbloodbovine, fear vodyanoi greatly!
2120018333/Lady smile, we smiles, even humans smiles. Oh hulalbul, malalghool, happy day...!
2120018334/Dagon dry...? Love to you. Sword fatigued from Dagon. Good sword from underwater city to you.
2120018335/We underwater-live, deep. We Lady love. Yet not all... Many Dagon love, Lady leave. They humans kill. I plea your sword Dagon dislove. My give reward.
2120018336/Fruits and nuts! Bigbloodbovine love fruits and nuts.
2120018337/Graol lol! Exact, disloving ghouls at crypt...
2120018338/Talk! Gool bool tahl Hool!
2120018339/Gool Bool tahl Hool! UUUURRrrrrLLLLoroor! GOOL GOOL!
2120018340/They be evil Dagonloalbaltol, dislove Lady's altar. I must had flee, now they in water and I guard altar again.
2120018341/Bigbloodbovine better idea. Yet obedient must be for Lady, choose...
2120018342/Prefer human sacrifice? Uurarolaolool!
2120018343/Hertsool Gool Bahl tahl Hooll! Oooooo! Graol Lol!
2120018344/Daoelaol! Your lang I speak - very well.
2120018345/Dool Bool tohl grool?
2120018346/Witchmolol bool.
2120018347/Witchmolol bool! Bool must be. No bool means... idiot!
2120018348/Yes, so you be.
2120018349/Exact!
2120018350/Gul! Bul! Humans great enemies to vodyanoi. Hire witcherbig for vodyanoi to kill. Witcherbig at crypt. We lovewish humans - yet humans swim our waters...
2120018351/Bigbloodbovine in village. Dagon for her come. Dislove Dagon, my give reward, something sword, something wonderful...
2120018352/Dislove bigbloodbovine on altar, Dagon come from deep.
2120018353/Kneel before Lady - speak easy. No kneel, must be Dagonlaolbaltol - nospeak!
2120018354/Ghoolboolgroolgoolooll!
2120018355/Do what you will. But remember, Foltest loves his daughter very much.
2120018356/Geralt...
2120018357/I saw you speaking with the king. I gather it was unpleasant.
2120018358/Dreadful. You warned us it might return. Can you break the spell a second time?
2120018359/Greetings, Geralt.
2120018360/Hmmph. I've served Temeria all my life. If they condemn me, I'll hold my head high as I walk to the gallows.
2120018361/At me?
2120018362/I don't know. These days, the corpses lie thicker than flies on a pile of manure.
2120018363/No, but she's been seen in Old Vizima. She may hunt there.
2120018364/We went to the manor at dawn and saw the two of you lying on the floor by the sarcophagus in a pool of blood. You were barely breathing, but the princess was cured... With the traitor Ostrit dead, the king was overjoyed.
2120018365/True, but the king has ways of 'encouraging' you to do it.
2120018366/You have nonhuman friends. Help Foltest and he might reconsider his decree about cropping ears and beards to a prescribed size...
2120018367/Certainly. You stayed from dusk till dawn in the old manor house where the striga had her sarcophagus. Kept half the city awake with the noise you made.
2120018368/He cast the curse out of jealousy. He loved the king's sister.
2120018369/We'll speak privately later.
2120018370/Hmmm... it's my job to tell you the striga was seen in Old Vizima, but privately...
2120018371/Farewell, witcher.
2120018372/Where?
2120018373/Geralt...
2120018374/The fighting continues. Too many flames for my people to put out... I'm going to retire when this ends.
2120018375/And...?
2120018376/Fine.
2120018377/Witcher, second time I underestimated you.
2120018378/The king said if you want to cure the disease, you must go to the Old Manor. He said you would understand.
2120018379/Goodbye.
2120018380/Ah, witcher, should've slain her the first time for a pot of gold. Would've ended the problem.
2120018381/Sorry, witcher. King's orders.
2120018382/Shame, I had been counting on you succeeding...
2120018383/Foltest gave me something for you in the event that you survived. This is the Devil, a Zerrikanian scimitar. The legends say it was tempered in dragon's blood.
2120018384/Greetings, Geralt. Foltest asked me to check on your progress.
2120018385/True, but this particular monster is his daughter.
2120018386/He cannot believe Adda turned into a beast by herself. The crypt may hide evidence.
2120018387/Follow me.
2120018388/Foltest asks that you search the sarcophagus where the princess sleeps. Surrender any evidence you find.
2120018389/Foltest well knows someone meddled with the curse.
2120018390/The gate is locked. First resolve the problem with the Beastie. You understand... Safety precautions.
2120018391/First gather the diary from the striga's sarcophagus. Then I'll unlock the door.
2120018392/Captain Vincent disburses rewards for slain monsters.
2120018393/For Temeria!
2120018394/Never raise your hand against me!
2120018395/Damn!
2120018396/At least you're here.
2120018397/I'll drive you from my city!
2120018398/Good to see you.
2120018399/Attack!
2120018400/Onward, soldiers!
2120018401/Not what I was thinking of.
2120018402/Withdraw!
2120018403/Gracious Sire, this is madness! You should not expose yourself to such danger! Wait here and allow me to summon a stronger force.
2120018404/He dropped in. He seems to have a talent for that. What shall I do with him?
2120018405/Gracious Sire...
2120018406/Nonhumans attacking! Protect the king!
2120018407/No need for formal introductions. If you wish to open a factory or a shop, kill a monster, or petition the king, you must come to me.
2120018408/Greetings, it's been a while.
2120018409/The remaining guests are in that room.
2120018410/I'm listening.
2120018411/Must go.
2120018412/She needs a man to give her a proper lay.
2120018413/Find me a stronger drink and we'll speak.
2120018414/I've not spoken to Adda without one of those bastards from the Order present.
2120018415/You're awfully close to treason...
2120018416/Everybody's asking that question today.
2120018417/I tell everyone the same. He'll return in due course.
2120018418/Shush. I could use something stronger. Fine, ask...
2120018419/Speak freely, Geralt. But no politics.
2120018420/Nothing better than a little down time.
2120018421/The food will disappear soon...
2120018422/I thought you a decent fellow...
2120018423/No politics...
2120018424/It's not strong enough.
2120018425/Oooo - much better. The princess had a hard childhood. It left her with a penchant for raw meat. We try to keep that quiet, but...
2120018426/How would I know?
2120018427/Thaler's angry - his intelligence agents scour the realm to fetch her treats.
2120018428/Our sweet princess is completely normal. Well, her head's a little messed up...
2120018429/Throat's dry...
2120018430/On occasion, but not unusual for a spoiled damsel. I don't know, she's...
2120018431/Well...
2120018432/Your gold.
2120018433/Certainly.
2120018434/I'll pay if you have 3.
2120018435/How dare you come here! After what you did at the bank?!
2120018436/Damn true. I'd die of boredom if not for dice.
2120018437/Which one?
2120018438/Bring 12 vials of blood as proof you killed the ghouls.
2120018439/I'll pay if you have 10.
2120018440/My hands are tied. I'd like to tell you why... but I can't.
2120018441/I'll pay if you have 5.
2120018442/Yes?
2120018443/So why bother me?
2120018444/We all know whose side you're on, elf lover.
2120018445/Say what you want. We know what happened there.
2120018446/Your gold.
2120018447/I've spoken to both Leuvaarden and Triss.
2120018448/We can start now.
2120018449/Perhaps. But the seal looks authentic...
2120018450/I'm old and tired. I prefer not to see Vizima ablaze.
2120018451/Lately, the Order of the Flaming Rose has become Vizima's chief center of power...
2120018452/I think the problem is much, much deeper.
2120018453/You'd lose. No offense, but you're better with the sword.
2120018454/Your gold.
2120018455/Someone close to the king...
2120018456/Unbelievable, the way they've packed us in down here.
2120018457/Some of Foltest's recent decisions... have been strange. I've long known him...
2120018458/I'm counting on you.
2120018459/Ghouls are an easy feat for you. Don't complain.
2120018460/Get some practice.
2120018461/With pleasure.
2120018462/Your reward.
2120018463/Welcome! I wanted to thank you for your help at the bank...
2120018464/They've taken over the larger hall upstairs... How are we supposed to fit down here?
2120018465/To reward you, I've decided to reveal some valuable information.
2120018466/Goodbye.
2120018467/We'll find him. You deserve a medal, witcher!
2120018468/Almost?
2120018469/The Scoia'tael are robbing the bank!
2120018470/We'll find him. You deserve a medal!
2120018471/Almost?
2120018472/A pedestrian overpass links it to the Town Hall. It's unused, but I have a key...
2120018473/Perhaps you can enter through the warehouse connection...
2120018474/I wouldn't advise a frontal assault...
2120018475/Geralt, they need support...
2120018476/Armed robbers have taken over the bank and are holding hostages. Siegfried's leading the assault.
2120018477/Witcher! I heard sounds of fighting?!
2120018478/The women who work at the Town Hall speak of ghosts...
2120018479/Finally, we can go home.
2120018480/We need help... Armed robbers have occupied the bank. They've taken hostages!
2120018481/Good luck!
2120018482/He's coming.
2120018483/We need help! The bank's being robbed!
2120018484/I have a job for you, Dandelion, regarding King Radovid. The witcher's flapping tongue would be a liability...
2120018485/I knew you'd be back sooner or later. You missed a lot.
2120018486/Yes. He's in Old Vizima. Knowing whose orders we're following really boosted morale...
2120018487/Good luck, witcher.
2120018488/Done! Dandelion, wait for me at the king's camp. Geralt, do what you must.
2120018489/I'm responsible for King Radovid's safety while he's in Temeria. We'd be deep in it if anything were to happen to him.
2120018490/Colder than a witch's tit. I'll take the streets of Vizima any day.
2120018491/Just like old times.
2120018492/Look, Geralt - humans, monsters... easy to mistake one for the other...
2120018493/The Grand Master is the vilest kind of criminal. We need to stop him.
2120018494/You've been busy. I'll gladly buy that trophy.
2120018495/You have the right to remain silent.
2120018496/What are you doing?
2120018497/I'll show you...!
2120018498/Imbeciles.
2120018499/Heard you're in trouble again.
2120018500/Something must be done about that...
2120018501/Drop your weapon!
2120018502/Hmmm...
2120018503/You do more harm than all the gangs put together.
2120018504/Amused? Not me.
2120018505/Jethro, open the cell.
2120018506/Professor, move it! You're free.
2120018507/Get out! And you men listen! There's something I want to tell you.
2120018508/All right, you maggots. The king in his mercy will pardon whoever subdues the cockatrice in the sewers.
2120018509/Get moving. We don't have all day.
2120018510/One more thing. I'll pay extra for the monster's head, provided it's undamaged...
2120018511/Congratulations. You won the right to slay the beast.
2120018512/Yes, idiot, that one!
2120018513/Clever. Watch what you say, witcher. Political jokes could get you in trouble.
2120018514/It's been a while since he went down into the sewers. Could be he had an accident...
2120018515/You want freedom? Fight for it. Whoever wins faces the cockatrice.
2120018516/The creep in the corner claims he'll defeat it bare fisted.
2120018517/Get it from Jethro. The rest of your gear's in deposit for afterwards.
2120018518/Don't get sarcastic. As runner-up, you get the honor of eliminating the cockatrice.
2120018519/Want to slay the beast or would you rather just stand there?
2120018520/That's funny, we recently confiscated a witcher's sword.
2120018521/Not your business. Jethro, bring that silver sword.
2120018522/Too late. There's another volunteer.
2120018523/Stay clear of the warehouses in the slums. It's a sensitive case that doesn't require your sword... just yet.
2120018524/Oh yes...?
2120018525/Continue...
2120018526/A special reward - this runic stone. Use it well.
2120018527/The first case, we pressure Ramsmeat; the second, we pass onto the Order or a witcher; the third, we go the victim's wife - the culprit ninety percent of the time.
2120018528/The law's the law.
2120018529/You're free, but you still need to observe the quarantine.
2120018530/It's a secret operation. How do you expect me to go - with an assault team in full plate armor and a bugler?
2120018531/I don't tell you how to hunt monsters - you don't tell me how to do my job. I let him out but I haven't lost his trail.
2120018532/I'm not gonna explain myself to you.
2120018533/I've got no time. End of conversation.
2120018534/We keep a close eye on you witchers.
2120018535/Interesting... thoroughly civic behavior, witcher. Surprising for an outca... Huh. My thanks. Here's your reward.
2120018536/What do you mean?
2120018537/What're you suggesting?
2120018538/Not a chance in hell! Get lost... Grrr...
2120018539/What the hell is this? The hideous things that roam this earth. That's 400 orens reward.
2120018540/Believe me, witcher, Raymond has excellent reasons to detest Salamandra... Besides, Javed leads them...
2120018541/Absolutely nothing. Forget about it... Patience, witcher. We'll get the bastard in good time...
2120018542/What is it, witcher?
2120018543/Listen carefully, Geralt of Rivia. For some time now, I've been conducting a complex investigation.
2120018544/Maybe we are. What's it to you?
2120018545/Enough! Anything specific? If not, beat it.
2120018546/You're lucky they didn't have any valuable information. They actually wanted to trick me.
2120018547/His bail was paid. That's the law.
2120018548/I don't care. Be warned. If you get in my way again, I'll slap your witcher's ass in jail. Understood?
2120018549/Such an investigation involves risks -- costly risks. What's more, supervisors expect results.
2120018550/If you stumble upon any real leads, come by. I'll give you some useful advice.
2120018551/Don't leave the Temple Quarter.
2120018552/Sounds like your mountain has turned into a mole hill. That's what happens when amateurs try their hand at serious work.
2120018553/I wish you'd said so sooner.
2120018554/Shut your mouth. I organize ambushes, setups. And every time I get to the scene, I learn some steaming pile of manure chopped everyone to bits!
2120018555/I said shut it! That pile of manure is you, no other. I've had enough of your suspicions, enough of your dismantling my plans, enough of your lopsided face! Grrr!!
2120018556/Okay...
2120018557/Not discussing it doesn't mean we've dropped the case.
2120018558/Meaning? No matter. Have a good time today, enjoy your freedom, and maybe tomorrow I'll serve you Javed's balls on a platter...
2120018559/Relax, I'm no rookie and I got a few things up my sleeve...
2120018560/If you're here about the warehouse, I'd advise you to think before saying anything...
2120018561/It's confidential. End of conversation.
2120018562/Show me.
2120018563/How did things go at the warehouse once I left?
2120018564/Nothing unnatural about spending nights in the Trade Quarter...
2120018565/I guess you plan to continue the investigation?
2120018566/You'll get no information -- out of me or my men.
2120018567/How did you figure that out?
2120018568/Mh, almost forgot. If it's true, and I suspect it is, then I gotta admit it... good work. Thanks.
2120018569/So, Raymond... Hmm... Geralt, I have to admit... good work. Full moon soon, I got paperwork to do... It'll take a while...
2120018570/I won't help with this vigilante investigation - the results are crap.
2120018571/Right now my budget includes reward money for the cockatrice in the sewers and for some bloodthirsty plant that kills people in the swamp.
2120018572/Impressive. That's 400 orens reward. Well deserved.
2120018573/Good. I admit I was hoping for a bit more, but it's always a few bandits less...
2120018574/I can't help officially, but I'll leave you to it. Anything you learn I'd be glad to hear.
2120018575/The warehouse was official business. The people you cut up wanted to testify against Salamandra.
2120018576/Had no choice, believe me. It won't happen again, you have my word.
2120018577/Don't always need coin to get by.
2120018578/The city should offer more rewards soon.
2120018579/Salamandra aims to take over the fisstech trade. Javed's smelled the money in it. He's a junkie himself.
2120018580/Patience, witcher. All will be explained tonight.
2120018581/I'm not gonna explain myself to you. End of conversation.
2120018582/Here's a City Guard ring. Wear it and the guards shouldn't give you any trouble.
2120018583/One more word, and it's the dungeon.
2120018584/What for? Punctured stomachs mean gang warfare, torn off heads mean beasts, and black tongues mean poison.
2120018585/Your reputation precedes you. I heard you killed three monsters and brought in proof.
2120018586/Finally sounding sensible.
2120018587/Bandits, monsters, the plague and you.
2120018588/What's Raymond?
2120018589/Curiosity is killing me.
2120018590/I'd rather not waste my men on that. I pay anyone who kills a monster. Just bring proof.
2120018591/Grrr, beat it!!!
2120018592/Autopsies are a waste of time.
2120018593/You accuse me and then you want help?
2120018594/No trouble. Maybe you can clean it up while you're there.
2120018595/Hmm...
2120018596/Hurry up and finish it. I can't wait all day.
2120018597/You know this could damage my career.
2120018598/I'm risking a lot meeting you.
2120018599/No, I'm leaving. Besides, I know you had a part in murdering Raymond's family. Witcher, make it quick.
2120018600/See ya.
2120018601/A regular idiot...
2120018602/Let's not play "Who killed who." That's the past, we're interested in the future. Your future, which will be unpleasant if Javed learns you cheated him. And believe me, he'll learn shortly if you don't start talking...
2120018603/See? Nothing to be afraid of. You didn't exactly come alone. Now, let's deal.
2120018604/Relax, just a witcher... Surely you know witchers are golems. No will of their own, follow orders quick and easy, no complaints... Right, Geralt?
2120018605/Greetings.
2120018606/I've heard rumors of a wolf and a wyvern creating mayhem in the swamp.
2120018607/I don't handle that anymore. Talk to the Royal Huntsman. He's stationed on a hill near the New Narakort in the Trade Quarter.
2120018608/Witcher-detective turns witcher-therapist.
2120018609/...It must be true.
2120018610/I'll think about it, witcher.
2120018611/Witcher...
2120018612/What's your beef? It's not my choice...
2120018613/Strength I use against evil...
2120018614/Don't kill me!
2120018615/I'm not evil! I extract the weeds of society, making it purer!
2120018616/You're in danger!
2120018617/Are you mad? I knew you wouldn't run. I even counted on it. Don't get yourself killed...
2120018618/The Salamanders will be here soon.
2120018619/Hurry.
2120018620/...Will understand.
2120018621/Huh... You must think poorly of me if you believe I'd let you face them alone. I expected you'd stay and fight. My people are ready. They volunteered...
2120018622/The militia learned of your meetings. Salamandra has spies in the army! You must flee!
2120018623/Help!
2120018624/I'm so clever.
2120018625/What am I to do?
2120018626/I'm angry.
2120018627/Quite the dangerous one bearing weapons on your back.
2120018628/Armed as you are, I'd stay clear of the guards.
2120018629/Disgusting trophy.
2120018630/Run!
2120018631/Put that away.
2120018632/It's drizzling.
2120018633/I hate this weather.
2120018634/How sad when it rains.
2120018635/I left the laundry drying.
2120018636/Run for your life!
2120018637/Hehe!
2120018638/I am ever so clever.
2120018639/What was I supposed to do?
2120018640/No!
2120018641/Wasting your time.
2120018642/It's drizzling.
2120018643/I don't like this weather.
2120018644/I get sad when it rains.
2120018645/I think I left the laundry out.
2120018646/Just a witcher.
2120018647/And nonhumans are rebelling! What's the world coming to?
2120018648/An old fool looking for adventure!
2120018649/You're right! I'll show him!
2120018650/He's too strong!
2120018651/He's too strong!
2120018652/Just our luck!
2120018653/Good food's hard to come by. When will the merchants be allowed back into the city?
2120018654/The elves are worst! I've despised those bastards since my daughter... let's drink.
2120018655/As Raupenneck says: the only good elf's a dead elf.
2120018656/The gods sent a messenger with a blazing sword.
2120018657/Perhaps this messenger transformed into a phantom hound?
2120018658/My, what a sight!
2120018659/And his knights stood pretty as a painting.
2120018660/Beasts everywhere... Help!
2120018661/Let me see...
2120018662/How often must I tell you?!
2120018663/Shove off, you lewd hog.
2120018664/No more credit.
2120018665/I daren't buy fish. Who knows how the plague spreads!
2120018666/How rude!
2120018667/Why do you gaze at me so?
2120018668/Swine!
2120018669/The impertinence!
2120018670/You a cultist or simply crude?
2120018671/Of course!
2120018672/Why should that interest you?
2120018673/Oh. I'll gladly help.
2120018674/Unless... a warm shawl for our long evenings. But tell none you gave it to me.
2120018675/Why should that interest you?
2120018676/Our children die frequently, because we live in the swamp.
2120018677/The impertinence!
2120018678/I'll gladly help you.
2120018679/You a cultist or simply crude?
2120018680/I'm certain.
2120018681/If you have coin, I'll teach you to recognize the swamp herbs.
2120018682/Swine!
2120018683/If you venture out into the swamp, you are bound to encounter a plant known as crow's eye. To my eye, its form resembles the cyprus. The roots of the crow's eye are large and have medicinal value, so the plant is worth gathering if only for that use.
2120018684/Why do you gaze at me so?
2120018685/There's also a special variety of fool's parsley. The leaves contain fibers used in weaving magical shirts. If a man transformed into a swan dons this shirt, he'll regain his human form.
2120018686/We don't like strangers here.
2120018687/Exactly what I thought. I'll tell you about swamp herbs now.
2120018688/In our village, the leader is the only woman to leave her home often.
2120018689/There's beggartick - a valuable plant used to produce hallucinogens. Ordinarily, a water plant, but here there's a type that grows on land with useful blossoms.
2120018690/Is Vizima really a den of depravity?
2120018691/Vaska is wise. Have you spoken to her?
2120018692/50 orens. Honey will do, too. My children love sweets, but I dare not search for wild bees.
2120018693/I don't talk to strangers.
2120018694/Druids from the grove have brought drought upon us.
2120018695/That's all I know.
2120018696/We only go out to gather herbs.
2120018697/And let others think me neglectful of my family? I won't accept any luxuries!
2120018698/No, he beat me so badly recently I spit out a tooth...
2120018699/I was jesting. My man would tear off my head if I went with you.
2120018700/Boys fight each other. Some wager on the outcome. Sometimes they beat up visitors. Altogether boring.
2120018701/Made up your mind?
2120018702/There's a comfortable bed out back... What'll it be?
2120018703/Hello. Fancy a meal? Or have you another reason for coming?
2120018704/Heelp! Noooo!
2120018705/Master Dandelion's concerts are exceptional...
2120018706/I'd like to know him better!
2120018707/Dandelion has discovered a new sound.
2120018708/What a fetching frock.
2120018709/Is there cloth at market?
2120018710/And none hate elves more than she?
2120018711/Who's White Rayla?
2120018712/Why is she special?
2120018713/No... a death sentence.
2120018714/The Squirrels have entered the city.
2120018715/They mark racists' doors with blood.
2120018716/Doubtless they're playing by the New Narakort.
2120018717/Remember when you were little?
2120018718/What happened?
2120018719/Waste of a cow.
2120018720/Time to leave this city.
2120018721/I'm not sentimental.
2120018722/Our days are numbered. So say the soothsayers.
2120018723/You mentioned it.
2120018724/I see more rats roaming the streets, and alleys reek of slime.
2120018725/Sometimes I fancy being a carefree she-elf living in a beautiful grove...
2120018726/I don't talk to strangers.
2120018727/I'd rather not speak.
2120018728/All right, tonight after dark.
2120018729/My husband suspects.
2120018730/It can get so dangerous at night.
2120018731/No! Begone.
2120018732/Be off, cur!
2120018733/Some compliment. I'm married.
2120018734/I pray I'm clean of the nonhuman plague of Old Vizima.
2120018735/Why hasn't the king armed the guilds? Perhaps he wants control of all armed men.
2120018736/I saw soldiers freeing bandits. Why does no one believe me?
2120018737/I'll not speak with you.
2120018738/I admire monastic knights, so handsome in their armor.
2120018739/I feel safe among the shadows of the city walls.
2120018740/Shove off!
2120018741/I assume you're here for a story, like everyone else.
2120018742/Wait, how did that story go...?
2120018743/I was clear about what I desire.
2120018744/I'd like to drink in peace.
2120018745/Exactly what I needed.
2120018746/The basilisk's horrifying gaze turns to stone all who venture into its underground lair.
2120018747/Wise treasure seekers take mirrors, yet mirrors are no protection against the lizard's deadly venom.
2120018748/One bite and the victim lies dead.
2120018749/Heard of wyverns?
2120018750/These terrifying creatures are the brood of dragons, yet they lack their parents' ingenuity and guile.
2120018751/They are vicious beyond measure. They take to the sky with membranous wings, fall on their victims, and kill them with one blow.
2120018752/It's said that druids have tamed wyverns. That's no surprise, for all know those mistletoe gatherers and beasts fare well together.
2120018753/Do you know deadly plants grow in the swamp?
2120018754/No ordinary plants, archespores grow where vicious crimes were committed.
2120018755/The gods curse fratricide and treachery and cause archespores to arise where either occurs.
2120018756/The hatred and wrong contained within them turns against the innocent, for archespores attack without mercy.
2120018757/The bodies of their victims fertilize the soil upon which the plants grow.
2120018758/My throat is parched. Fetch me a drink and I'll gladly share my knowledge.
2120018759/Water.
2120018760/A mug of beer.
2120018761/Milk.
2120018762/I'm in the mood to spin a tale.
2120018763/Yes, I saw some blooming in a garden by a gathering of huts here in the outskirts.
2120018764/Last I got tulips my beloved called me the most beautiful... You find me fetching?
2120018765/Thank you! They're lovely, though I favor tulips. They remind me of passionate days...
2120018766/I like travelers... One showered me with flowers...
2120018767/Oh my, delightful... I hope we meet again...
2120018768/Greetings, handsome traveler.
2120018769/What a shameless wench, that she-elf Toruviel.
2120018770/I hope the elves leave this place as soon as possible.
2120018771/Oh, for a son as handsome as Alvin.
2120018772/You prefer she-elves? Well I never!
2120018773/My grandma says nothing matches the beauty and danger of the noonwraith's dance.
2120018774/I love to see happy children at play.
2120018775/Whoever took our champion cow wishes to win the awards she'll bring.
2120018776/The vodyanoi also worship the Lady. Perhaps we have a lot more in common.
2120018777/How lucky we had a witcher to send the noonwraith away.
2120018778/The vodyanoi sit quiet in the water. Will it last?
2120018779/So romantic - Adam killed himself over Alina.
2120018780/Peace with the vodyanoi, like in the good old days.
2120018781/Alina, the village mayor's daughter, will marry soon. To the wealthy merchant Julian no less.
2120018782/Our champion cow disappeared!
2120018783/Look here, our champion cow!
2120018784/The Squirrels and the Order - those dry ones disturb our swamp.
2120018785/Water Lords have mercy!
2120018786/I had a dream, white-haired one. Your destiny will be fulfilled. I come to tell you: mistake not the stars with their reflection in a pond's surface.
2120018787/I curse you in the name of the Lords!
2120018788/Argh...
2120018789/Amanum gual eath.
2120018790/We could use more rain.
2120018791/Lords help me!
2120018792/Greetings, white-haired killer.
2120018793/What do you wish?
2120018794/White-haired one... there were signs of fighting there, and not with monsters. He was attacked by men.
2120018795/The apprentice stole the card and made two copies. I doubt they ever left the swamp.
2120018796/Unimportant.
2120018797/How dare you! Those names offend the Lords!
2120018798/Blind love spelled the mage's demise. He called upon forces he could not control and died.
2120018799/Hard times... Speak, what do witchers do?
2120018800/We mine clay and produce bricks.
2120018801/Vaska, the village eldress.
2120018802/As if drowned then resurrected.
2120018803/Indeed. Creatures have made nests in the clay pits.
2120018804/Like a sword you cut through the veil of mystery. The one they call Gramps will satisfy your curiosity. I must remain silent until the appointed time.
2120018805/Wonderful! Now we prepare for the coming of the Lords!
2120018806/A traveler from distant lands! He has lost something he now seeks.
2120018807/Then we happened upon his gear in a clay pit, covered in blood.
2120018808/Never! We know only brickmaking.
2120018809/Want to ask something?
2120018810/Beware of flaming lizards and dry ones. I need you alive.
2120018811/Towards the landing, but take the other road at the fork. At its end you'll spot our tormentors.
2120018812/We're poor folks, I can pay no more than 50 orens.
2120018813/As the saying goes: "He will be naive and humble as a saint, but will bear your enemies on his sword.”
2120018814/Make haste, white-haired one.
2120018815/No. Though the city grows in need of bricks, the carriers and merchants snatch most of our profit.
2120018816/We mine clay to form bricks we bake in ovens.
2120018817/We worship them and receive the grace of those from the eternal Deep.
2120018818/Return later.
2120018819/Die, perish!
2120018820/A powerful sorcerer once lived in the swamp, an apprentice his only companion. All changed when a woman entered his life.
2120018821/But the end differs, for a wicked woman she was. He fulfilled all her wishes, and she took advantage of his might.
2120018822/The mage's lover could tell fortunes and the mage created a deck of extraordinary Tarot cards - he illustrated a future event on each card.
2120018823/He has... asking different questions... about those... alchemies. The alchemist Kalkstein must have sent him.
2120018824/Golems guarded the mage's dwelling. Those spared the ravages of time survive at the cemetery, where they remain motionless.
2120018825/Yes, the most powerful golem acted as Sentry. The Tower card depicts how the golem can be revived. In turn, this will open the tower anew.
2120018826/Life is good. In the evenings we tell stories and play dice.
2120018827/You showed us mercy, yet I deceived you. I can offer no money.
2120018828/But you cannot leave unrewarded. Take this amulet. It's Kezath, the symbol of mercy.
2120018829/Take this card. I no longer need it.
2120018830/Make haste and beware the druids.
2120018831/All trappings of dry land signify resentment.
2120018832/The one they call Gramps will satisfy your curiosity.
2120018833/Speak with reverence about the Lords!
2120018834/The boy must speak with the Water Lords.
2120018835/Have you found the missing child?
2120018836/The Water Lords are nigh.
2120018837/Please help! One of our children is missing! The boy has always returned quickly, until now.
2120018838/The mage's lover could tell fortunes and the mage created a deck of extraordinary Tarot cards - he illustrated a future event on each card.
2120018839/By the oven, between the clay pits.
2120018840/Yes... Asking about... "alchemies." He wandered about the mage's tower. Kalkstein doubtless sent him.
2120018841/We can't complain. Work during the day and evenings filled with stories and playing dice.
2120018842/The woodcutters should lay down their weapons as a sign of peace. Offer their leader's axe unto the Water Lords. Humble yourself before them! If the Lords see no falsity in your heart, they will lift you up, and the woodcutters need fear no more. But first, you must last the night in a sign of humility.
2120018843/Vodyanoi?
2120018844/Evil men from dry lands, flaming lizards. Beware!
2120018845/Whosoever raises his hand against the Water Lords will draw back a bleeding stump!
2120018846/I saw signs of fighting there - not monsters, but men.
2120018847/A powerful sorcerer once lived in the swamp, an apprentice his only companion. All changed when a woman entered his life.
2120018848/The boy is gone - a warning to all. We must prepare.
2120018849/The Water Lords grant mercy to those who recognize the Truth of their mission. The woodcutters have naught to fear.
2120018850/Blasphemy! The druids must have him to transform into a dryad.
2120018851/But the end differs, for a wicked woman she was. He fulfilled all her wishes, and she took advantage of his might.
2120018852/Then we found his gear, covered in blood, in a clay pit.
2120018853/Golems guarded the mage's dwelling. Those spared the ravages of time survive at the cemetery, where they remain motionless.
2120018854/You can gain favor by placing plants on the altar as sacrifice.
2120018855/Yes, the most powerful golem acted as Sentry. The Tower card depicts how the golem can be revived. In turn, this will open the tower anew.
2120018856/Unimportant.
2120018857/Blind love spelled the mage's demise. He called upon forces he could not control and died.
2120018858/Avoid gifts unpleasing to the Lords - all that harms life-giving waters.
2120018859/Brews and incense. When placed on the altar, our ill recover miraculously.
2120018860/The apprentice stole the card and made two copies. I doubt they ever left the swamp.
2120018861/May you be damned to the Deep!
2120018862/We believe the world emerged from the waters, which will engulf the world once more. The dry lands birthed all evil. The Water Lords are divine beings who have retained ancient wisdom, but beneath them lies the One God, the Creator of all, the Dweller of the Deep, The-One-Who-Will-Come-In-Anger.
2120018863/We know little of the Lords' language. We communicate through objects we conceal in the altar. We receive answers after a Lord has visited.
2120018864/You are not one of us - contact the Lords and acknowledge their power.
2120018865/A God above all gods. I cannot speak of Him with the uninitiated.
2120018866/Take this card. I no longer need it.
2120018867/It hath been foretold: blessed waters shall pour down and the world consumed into the Deep.
2120018868/You shall be elevated and your foes vanquished. The world shall humble itself, for who can be above the Lords?
2120018869/Whosoever raises his hand against the Water Lords, loses that hand.
2120018870/Pray and you shall be elevated. Humble yourselves and the world shall be yours.
2120018871/Only fools mock the Water Lords and live in the Dry Lands. When the time comes, fish will consume the fools.
2120018872/Through me speaks the Tradition.
2120018873/The waters will burst their banks like a king ascending his throne.
2120018874/The waters will rise and the Lords shall come, so says Tradition.
2120018875/I convey knowledge thrice sanctified. Whosoever can hear, bid him heed the wisdom.
2120018876/Yes. But we have another problem.
2120018877/Greetings. Much has changed - townsfolk have violated our swamp.
2120018878/I thank you, White Wolf.
2120018879/Any other questions?
2120018880/They separate our kin into groups. Armed guards watch them.
2120018881/I saw one group by the fallen tower. Please help them. I'll reward you.
2120018882/Dry ones!
2120018883/A great battle between a man with a fiery soul and an elven lord!
2120018884/They drove off the lumberjacks and many were slain. They carry off our kin... The Water Lords are angry. Only the druids dare remain in the grove.
2120018885/Our Lords were victorious. Praise be to them!
2120018886/I know how best to reward you.
2120018887/I bestow upon you the Water Lords' blessing. You may bathe in the holy waters of the swamp and rejoice.
2120018888/Please hurry, their families miss them!
2120018889/It has been said: Whosoever understands the Lords will be solitary among the crowd, for their thoughts flow like the deep waters...
2120018890/...From a drowned woman born, he shall lead those who walk the Lords' path to the underwater kingdom...
2120018891/The man with the fiery soul came with his steel-clad brothers. They angered the Lords and dark waters engulfed them.
2120018892/I thank you for your bravery. If you are to destroy the bandits, seek the Hierophant in the grove. The druids are watching Salamandra.
2120018893/The one who steps lightly through shadow and whose heart is consumed by hatred went to face them. They met in a terrible, savage battle, staining the waters red. Who won, you ask? The Fire or the Shadow? My answer is: Neither.
2120018894/Bandits with Salamander badges are forcing my kin to gather herbs!
2120018895/What?
2120018896/Their boss, Roland Bleinheim, is an evil man. Kill him...
2120018897/Triss, tend to the mage, please. My medallion's going wild...
2120018898/We'll handle it. Any idea who the second mage is?
2120018899/Did he call for help?
2120018900/The other mage, maybe he's the boss...
2120018901/I've defended this fortress with my life and I won't stop now.
2120018902/Swallow is a healing potion.
2120018903/Thunderbolt is a combat potion. Your body will tense up, adrenaline will course...
2120018904/Makes it tough to focus on defense. And a hangover.
2120018905/Remember, Geralt, humans hate us mutants. They've always sought to destroy us.

2120018912/Geralt, you and Leo run to the lab. I'll tend to Triss. Be careful. We don't know who we're dealing with.
2120018913/Sorry to say, Triss was right. We must stop them!
2120018914/Let's do this! Bleed them a bit down here before withdrawing. Geralt, follow the wall and break through to the tower where there's a passage to the Upper Courtyard.
2120018915/They're just bandits, though one might be infamous. You must open the gate, we'll be waiting! Good luck, Wolf.
2120018916/The frightener is very dangerous, but it's vulnerable to loud noises...
2120018917/Exactly... Eskel, Lambert, you'll help me stop the frightener and the bandits. Leo, stay behind us. Geralt, you open the gate to the Upper Courtyard.
2120018918/When we're there, Triss can stop Savolla and his pet while we prepare to deal with the Professor and the unknown mage.
2120018919/Geralt, this Tawny Owl potion restores endurance... If there's a fight, hit the bell and cauldrons with the Aard. We need noise! I want them to hear us in Vizima!
2120018920/It's decided then. Eskel and Lambert will stay with me.
2120018921/Enough! Lambert, stop baiting Triss, show her some respect. Triss, if we go to the lab, they'll have us surrounded. We know tactics.
2120018922/I'll stay and handle the frightener and Savolla. What about you, Geralt? We may both need your help...
2120018923/What did you learn?
2120018924/Triss, child, it didn't seem important...
2120018925/All right, we made a mistake, but you said the mage was harmless...
2120018926/Geralt! Grab the sword!

2120018934/Enough. We need to check the other possible passages. To the Upper Courtyard.
2120018935/Dammit, Geralt. It's a miracle you're alive.
2120018936/We shouldn't turn our backs on a strong mage leading a frightener...
2120018937/Geralt, you've dealt with mages. Find out what this one wants. Leo will guide you.
2120018938/One thing at a time.
2120018939/We'll make sure no one else gets inside.
2120018940/No one will be sorry if some of them lose their heads. You'll manage, Wolf. Just remember Leo's with you.
2120018941/Triss, child, we have nothing of value. Some good steel, snow fox pelts...
2120018942/Right as usual, Triss.
2120018943/Triss, stay with us in case Savolla has any new ideas...
2120018944/Take these potions just in case. Drink the Thunderbolt now, and keep Swallow for when you need healing... I'll be able to tell you how they work.

2120018952/These are bad times for witchers... And something tells me they'll only get worse.
2120018953/You look tired, I'd like you to rest. I'll keep watch and tend to Leo's body.
2120018954/Let's get to work.
2120018955/Later I'll teach you how to extract ingredients from monsters. I'll be in the main hall.
2120018956/They'll pay for this.
2120018957/How did this happen?
2120018958/Lambert will give you the formula. Look for him by the fireplace, he's with our brave sorceress.
2120018959/Feels guilty, I think. The first thing Triss'll hear when she wakes is "Finally awake, Merigold." That's Lambert.
2120018960/Relatively. Some stragglers up there, but we'll deal with them later.
2120018961/Yes, we need to finish things. But first we must make a healing potion for Triss. We'll need to search for ingredients, nothing useful left here...
2120018962/We need to bid Leo farewell and wait for Triss to recover.
2120018963/Eskel came by while you were resting. Triss is still unconscious but stable...
2120018964/I've made a decision, Wolf. We abandon Kaer Morhen. There's nothing holding us here.
2120018965/Yes?
2120018966/Upstairs. Lambert's in the library, and Eskel's taking Triss to her room.
2120018967/Not too much. Sorceresses and their vainglory... though compared to others Triss seems an angel. Thanks for backing me. Oh, I have something for you. You might find this meteorite useful.
2120018968/Don't mention it.
2120018969/He often ran away from Kaer Morhen, though he would always return in the end.
2120018970/After the Trial of the Grasses, he finally accepted his destiny and started training for real.
2120018971/I don't know. We lost touch with him a while back.
2120018972/I don't believe so. An introvert, he chose his own path.
2120018973/I take it Triss has recovered.
2120018974/You just dropped one.
2120018975/Good. Now rest and prepare the potion according to the formula.
2120018976/Actually, none here can say they know Berengar.
2120018977/Sure, here.
2120018978/I take it you already have White Gull and Calcium Equum.
2120018979/You've met all the witchers I know of, except for Berengar...
2120018980/You'll need celandine. Take what I have.
2120018981/There were three witchers' schools in all, but it's been long since I've heard word of the other two.
2120018982/Perhaps. And perhaps something detains him.
2120018983/All right, let's begin. Remember, we leave right after the funeral.
2120018984/You'll find the frightener's carcass in the Upper Courtyard. Once you've extracted the claw, rest by the fire while making the potion.
2120018985/To skin a creature, take a sharp knife and cut along the torso.
2120018986/Yes?
2120018987/I'll have another claw and more celandine.
2120018988/You'll have to find more.
2120018989/Let's go.
2120018990/Plus, the claw of a monster, like the frightener...
2120018991/Here.
2120018992/No, but the mage suggests no ordinary bandits. We found pins adorned with salamanders on the dead. The symbol of their organization, perhaps? I sense hard times ahead.
2120018993/Of course.
2120018994/You just droppped some...
2120018995/Good you went after Triss and handled that mage...
2120018996/Eskel has alcohol, and I saw Calcium Equum somewhere upstairs... But try to get it right the first time, it's not that hard...
2120018997/Yes. Fifteen witchers once lived here, training boys for their Trials. Only they knew the secrets of mutation. Witchers who set out on the Path and failed to assimilate among humans wintered here.
2120018998/Unfortunately, Triss had to get past Savolla first, giving them time. They took almost everything. But the devices aren't most important.
2120018999/I never knew why they came. Some say a sudden explosion of anger born of disdain for witchers.
2120019000/Truer still, the fanatics could never have taken the fort without the aid of sorcerers, though they outnumbered us by far.
2120019001/They didn't even spare the youngest. I alone survived, concealed among the corpses.
2120019002/One of hundreds of orphans of the war with Nilfgaard. I apprenticed him six years ago.
2120019003/Our beautiful sorceress was right, I know.
2120019004/Ah, that was a tough fight.
2120019005/You did well, Wolf. Take this armor and sword. I've been keeping them for you.
2120019006/I understand they won't be a problem. Lambert, however, let the frightener get to him. Nothing serious...
2120019007/But no, someone provoked the mob with fliers filled with lies. Special agents read them to the peasants.
2120019008/We'll recover our secrets and find Leo's murderers, even if they fled to the end of the world.
2120019009/You did well, Wolf. Take this armor and sword. I've been keeping them for you.
2120019010/We might not've taken down the frightener without you.
2120019011/Walk around, Wolf. The skeletons remain. You may find a flier, there used to be hundreds. Memorize it as a warning of the evil humans can perpetrate.
2120019012/Without you, the frightener might have finished us...
2120019013/Ah, that was a tough fight.
2120019014/Before the battle, 23 witchers and 40 students called Kaer Morhen home... Too damned few for the mob that attacked.
2120019015/Our life is in your hands! Open the gate!
2120019016/Geralt! Why are you still here? Go open the gate!
2120019017/We can't hold them forever! Open the gate!
2120019018/Die, bastard!
2120019019/Don't!
2120019020/Get out of my way!
2120019021/Bandit scum.
2120019022/You've forgotten nothing of what I taught you.
2120019023/We'll punish them.
2120019024/What do you think Geralt, is he ready for the path?
2120019025/I keep repeating this! Pirouette, always followed by a back cross parry. Always!
2120019026/Not bad. Take a rest.

2120019034/They're coming up here. Get ready.
2120019035/The ground is shaking, feel it?
2120019036/The ground is shaking, feel it?
2120019037/He needs White Raffard's Decoction!
2120019038/What happened?
2120019039/I can't find it...

2120019044/NOT_USED
2120019045/It was here!
2120019046/South, to Temeria. King Foltest owes you a debt of gratitude. Some time ago, you removed a curse from his daughter. You might happen on the bandits' trail there. And you, Triss?
2120019047/We don't know where the bandits came from or who's behind them. We'll draw attention if we venture out as a group. By splitting up, we can also cover more territory.
2120019048/NOT_USED
2120019049/It's decided then. Eskel will go toward the coast. Lambert to Kaedwen. Geralt to Temeria. I shall go north, to Kovir and Poviss.
2120019050/A true feast on these streets...
2120019051/I'm calmed.
2120019052/I no longer need to hide in the cemetery. It's safer here. I come out at night, find food in the streets. Can't complain.
2120019053/Witcher! Good to see you.
2120019054/I'm a mutant as are you. Born with the gift of speech and an intelligence like that of humans.
2120019055/They fear me. The little brat comes alone, talks without end.
2120019056/I am a threat only to those who threaten me.
2120019057/Trouble approaches... Don't kill me, witcher.
2120019058/I only kill people in self-defense. The pointy-eared ones probably did it...
2120019059/Really? I'll feast on witcher...
2120019060/I hate to boast, but I am exceptional. My kin prefer growling.
2120019061/Hey, not my work. I don't eat live ones. I'll tell you who’s to blame if you spare my life.
2120019062/They taste terrible and they bring us food.
2120019063/Be seeing you.
2120019064/The pointy-eared ones! They rob graves and sneak about. Whoever's in their way, they kill.
2120019065/Mmm, slurp, delicious, buurrp. Oops, where are my manners?
2120019066/Never seen a ghoul before?
2120019067/Farewell.
2120019068/Damn humans will seize what little gold I have.
2120019069/War can be profitable. If not for the king's taxes, the plague take them!
2120019070/And all their heads are filled with prophesies, destinies, strange signs and other nonsense. No one to talk to.
2120019071/Don't you see? Knights, soldiers and Scoia'tael run through the streets, cutting down who they can. I am a traitor to all of them.
2120019072/Greetings.
2120019073/Zoltan was right to praise you...
2120019074/Any guilty nonhumans involved?
2120019075/You insult me, witcher.
2120019076/You offend me deeply with this slander.
2120019077/I have little choice.
2120019078/Interesting...
2120019079/Kind to be so frank with a dwarf.
2120019080/You suspect me because I'm a dwarf?
2120019081/I understand their cause, though I don't approve.
2120019082/You've rejected racial prejudice and realised the truth.
2120019083/What brings you here?
2120019084/Leave me, racist.
2120019085/Feel free.
2120019086/Me? How so? Have you humans completely lost your wits?
2120019087/Whatever next?
2120019088/That bank has belonged to my family for ages, and now some human... You call this justice?!
2120019089/I saw his name in old files. He paid tuition at the sorcerers' school in Ban Ard.
2120019090/Very observant.
2120019091/Come back when you stop talking crap!
2120019092/Return later, after I prepare my answer to Yaevinn.
2120019093/He was expelled after taking an interest in dark magic. He stopped paying tuition and that was the last trace of him in our system.
2120019094/What, then?!
2120019095/Get out, witcher! Don't ever come back!
2120019096/I've no time.
2120019097/Within the law. If we've no faith in the law, we've nothing. Now, goodbye.
2120019098/I would never resort to villainy! Get out!
2120019099/Bah! You're like everyone else, like the whole accursed city! Vizima: humans get everything; we get naught.
2120019100/What do you want?!
2120019101/Racial segregation with the first words uttered.
2120019102/What do you want?
2120019103/In that case, sorry... I'm Golan Vivaldi. My cousin, Vimme Vivaldi, once met a witcher, a debt collector, apparently...
2120019104/When you discover the true culprit, you tell me. I'm curious who it is.
2120019105/Yes, I have that left.
2120019106/How witty. Shove off. Come back later for my answer to the elf.
2120019107/I'm not sure I want to know you.
2120019108/Yaevinn? I don't need to read it. I know what he wants. Witcher, know that whether elf, human or dwarf - they all want the same thing.
2120019109/My distant cousin Rudolph is a shepherd. His entire life, he has driven three hundred sheep from one place to another. He's the master of their life and death. Somehow I don't envy him.
2120019110/Gold, indeed. If you care to drop by later, you can collect my answer to Yaevinn.
2120019111/Why?
2120019112/I have information about Javed that might be useful.
2120019113/Generations of Vivaldis built this bank and you suggest our gold serves criminals! Out!
2120019114/But don't count on getting any gold from me. Yaevinn has doubtless promised you some already.
2120019115/You're dealing with a renegade... and a dangerous one at that.
2120019116/Cooperation is the only way of taking care of my interests.
2120019117/I don't want to discuss it.
2120019118/Yes, here it is. The elf will surely reward you.
2120019119/Hmm...
2120019120/I see... Well, you can stop smiling; I have nightmares aplenty as it is. But be reasonable. If I were you I'd contact Kalkstein. Every spell deserves a counter-spell. The alchemist might help you.
2120019121/I do, but I'm unwilling to part with it.
2120019122/You pulled me from prison. Take it as a gift.
2120019123/I do, in what remains of my collection. It's yours if you want it.
2120019124/So be it.
2120019125/Detective Raymond? Hmm... but that would mean...
2120019126/Actually, they're trying to contact me. Big difference.
2120019127/I never figured you'd understand me.
2120019128/I'm impressed. What will you do?
2120019129/I'm supposed to be working with bandits who slay my brethren?! You're blinded by racism!
2120019130/No, it's a mistake! My nephew is young and foolish, not a murderer!
2120019131/Geralt.
2120019132/I reek of prison... We'll talk at my house.
2120019133/Mercy!
2120019134/All hope's lost.
2120019135/We must bow before death's verdict.
2120019136/I feel life seeping from me.
2120019137/Flee if you wish to live. I'm sick!
2120019138/Have mercy!
2120019139/Why me?
2120019140/I barely smell the stench anymore.
2120019141/Death approaches every night.
2120019142/Alms for the poor.
2120019143/You reek of corpses.
2120019144/Show mercy. The gods will reward you.
2120019145/I never hurt a soul!
2120019146/I don't want that.
2120019147/I'm all wet.
2120019148/Rain again...
2120019149/My bones ache.
2120019150/Heeeelp!
2120019151/How much longer?...
2120019152/I work too hard.
2120019153/I need a rest.
2120019154/No, don't!
2120019155/Stupid?
2120019156/What bad weather.
2120019157/Raining again.
2120019158/No need to water my garden.
2120019159/Storm's come in.
2120019160/Don't disturb!
2120019161/Wink at my husband, and I'll scratch your eyes out.
2120019162/Liar! I know your kind.
2120019163/Is war imminent?
2120019164/Clearly, the army stands ready.
2120019165/They say the last nonhuman left the quarter.
2120019166/I hold nothing against nonhumans.
2120019167/Can he hear us?
2120019168/Let's quiet down.
2120019169/Ointment made of dryads' palms smoothes your skin.
2120019170/But Brokilon foresters demand much for those palms.
2120019171/Lack of wood annoys merchants.
2120019172/The Scoia'tael summoned a horrific phantom to massacre humans.
2120019173/Begone!
2120019174/The impertinence!
2120019175/Swine!
2120019176/Are you a cultist or a pig?
2120019177/I'll help.
2120019178/Why do you gaze at me?
2120019179/Certain.
2120019180/Why ask that?
2120019181/Nonhumans don't scheme as many claim, do they?
2120019182/I'd rather not speak.
2120019183/You think I'd be consumed by love?
2120019184/You're wrong!
2120019185/You must think you can sweep any lady off her feet.
2120019186/You think I'd go to bed with you?!
2120019187/Bandits wearing the salamander sign robbed me clean last night!
2120019188/You're not from these parts?
2120019189/Stay away from that witch Abigail.
2120019190/A witcher? I thought your kind were eradicated.
2120019191/If you're naughty, the vodyanoi will steal you away to the Underwater City.
2120019192/Then run straight home.
2120019193/Be kind.
2120019194/No, you chase the boys instead of helping your mother.
2120019195/They will when they rip your head off.
2120019196/Don't tell anyone, but Strawberry looks slightly ill.
2120019197/Stay here. Remember no playing in the fields.
2120019198/Noonwraiths dance there. They could kill you.
2120019199/Silly, only sirens, tritons and vodyanoi can see the city.
2120019200/Silly dear.
2120019201/Don't be a brat.
2120019202/Remember, your ancestors came from the Underwater City.
2120019203/I'm pleased to be of use.
2120019204/I feared an aquarian hid in my well, but I merely saw my reflection.
2120019205/I beheld a planetor yesterday. He shook his fist at me from the clouds above!
2120019206/I'll speak plainly - I like what I see and want to get to know you.
2120019207/A sugar doll sweet as me! Just what I wanted!
2120019208/Hehehe, you're nice... maybe you could...
2120019209/Now that we know each other better, you should take the initiative and bring me something sweet.
2120019210/That nasty baker refuses to bake me one.
2120019211/I'm no easy lass, though. You understand a gentleman must court a lady. Am I right?
2120019212/The bruxa is a vompyre, a vampire almost as horrid as the nosferatu.
2120019213/She proved to be a bruxa, in truth!
2120019214/Bruxae give you nightmares. Usually they remain silent, though they can scream terribly. Fortunately, they cannot stand garlic. Oh! They're rendered helpless when you cut off their heads.
2120019215/Quite attractive, bruxae easily lead foolish boys astray. She has her way with them, then sucks their life away.
2120019216/My grandmother told me of vampires when I was young.
2120019217/Have you heard of Gimpy Mary? Turned into a swan by the Lady of the Lake, then flew off into the world as she had long wished.
2120019218/Have you tried our baker's goods? Magnificent!
2120019219/Mmmm... how wonderful... I'll gladly meet you again.
2120019220/Come home with me. Let me thank you.
2120019221/I've always wanted a sugar doll as sweet as me!
2120019222/Too good for me? I take back everything I said!
2120019223/I saw a rusalka by the lake, but was puzzled to see her bleeding from the mouth. I asked witcher Berengar about her.
2120019224/Do witchers prepare magic potions?
2120019225/I won't speak with a treacherous mutant.
2120019226/I'll let them know!
2120019227/Oh my!
2120019228/But my cousin truly suffers from poison!
2120019229/I knew you wouldn't disappoint me! Thank you!
2120019230/Monsters are the true plague. Witchers are needed.
2120019231/I'm desperate for a boy's attention. Have you perfume?
2120019232/The beast was terrifying, its head deformed, its jaws horrific.
2120019233/Perhaps you can help. My cousin from Vizima lies dying from a venomous monster attack. The medics have no cure. Perhaps you know an antidote?
2120019234/A garkain. It resembled a man, but with wings like a bat.
2120019235/Thank you. Your 100 orens.
2120019236/How malicious. Clearly, peaceful co-existence with witchers is impossible.
2120019237/Beautiful scent. The boy'll be wooing me soon.
2120019238/I know you can make perfumes. I'd gladly pay you 50 orens.
2120019239/Nice of you, thank you.
2120019240/A witcher, right?
2120019241/Keep away from elves or they may stay for good.
2120019242/I know exactly what you're thinking, gazing at me that way!
2120019243/I dreamt of a world encased in ice. A refreshing dream in heat like this, heehee!
2120019244/My wife's a whore...
2120019245/I'm c-c-c-oolld....
2120019246/Where's my body?
2120019247/It's a passion, not a game.
2120019248/Return when you've gotten some practice.
2120019249/I'll manage.
2120019250/I did not return to play novices.
2120019251/Who dares bother me?
2120019252/I speak of dice, of course.
2120019253/Geralt of Rivia himself... You're renowned in the realm of the dead.
2120019254/Gladly.
2120019255/Some warmth, understanding...
2120019256/The sole thing capable of overcoming death.
2120019257/Don't fret. I'm joking. I just haunt this place.
2120019258/Don't hit me. I just want to play...
2120019259/I know. Made and lost fortunes playing poker. Lost my life, too, in a stroke of bad luck.
2120019260/Ha! I didn't know you to be a romantic.
2120019261/Oooooo...
2120019262/Confident. Splendid.
2120019263/Normally I'm kind, just lonely of late. I'd like Alvin to keep me company playing dice. He's a clever boy.
2120019264/A classic solution, then. Let's play for him. The loser leaves the boy to the other.
2120019265/Geralt of Rivia himself... You're renowned in the ghost world.
2120019266/You err.
2120019267/What did you say? You cannot provoke me, witcher. You shall not pass without good reason.
2120019268/What do you mean?
2120019269/No one is allowed to pass. Grand Master's orders.
2120019270/Are you mad, witcher?
2120019271/Geralt...
2120019272/No titles, please. Let us bury past misunderstandings in the name of a greater cause.
2120019273/Not surprising. You succeeded once, though it nearly cost you your life. The striga's appearance possibly spells the end for Foltest. Many say he offended the gods. Remember how she first became a striga?
2120019274/I've heard rumor of an additional reward for killing the striga...
2120019275/Witcher...
2120019276/You should be. It's your choice, witcher, but give it some thought.
2120019277/Wherever did you get that idea, witcher?
2120019278/Obviously, he spoke of the blood of traitors and nonhumans. He might finally dispose of that failure Velerad.
2120019279/A fresh yet unsigned decree on the king's desk disbands the Order. If you asked the king to reconsider... well, your friend Siegfried would be grateful.
2120019280/The striga's reappearance proves the royal dynasty is cursed. The people are sensitive to such signs. No wonder Foltest wants you to kill the striga.
2120019281/Then simply get rid of the striga...
2120019282/Five thousand orens.
2120019283/No. However, there are other things to consider. If you do solve the striga problem, the king might take his savior's advice.
2120019284/You are to keep the striga from becoming an eyesore...
2120019285/As a youth Foltest had quite an appetite... So much so that he plowed his own sister. Their child died at birth, but then continued to grow in its coffin, only coming out to feed. Then you arrived and broke the spell, though apparently not completely...
2120019286/To hell with it! Witcher, align yourself with the masters of a new order - with me, Roderick de Wett, the future viceroy of Temeria!
2120019287/My dear Geralt...
2120019288/You look terrible, like you haven't slept all night...
2120019289/With a striga? To what end? Did you kill her?
2120019290/State your business, witcher.
2120019291/Do I not fit your vision of a noble knight of the Order? I weap to hear it, witcher. Ha ha!
2120019292/Fuck yourself, mutant! You shall die at my sword.
2120019293/No, you are, mutant. I gave you an opportunity to taste power. You chose not to, so you will die like a dog!
2120019294/But... To hell with it! Witcher, join me. Align yourself with the masters of a new order - with me, Roderick de Wett, the future viceroy of Temeria!
2120019295/They're but a means to an end. Join me!
2120019296/I thought you had that figured out. I'm working with Salamandra... for now.
2120019297/Any idea who?
2120019298/You should give me Ostrit's diary. The Grand Master commands magic better than that witch Merigold.
2120019299/Despite your insults, I shall help you battle the Grand Master.
2120019300/Though in the grand scheme of things, it matters little which of you dies. Either way, there will be one monster less...
2120019301/The two of you are like brothers, Geralt.
2120019302/Surprised? We're not so different after all. I am your hatred for monsters.
2120019303/You detest monsters as much as I do. You saw through both Adda and Vincent. That demands respect.
2120019304/Retreat! Fall back!
2120019305/For victory!
2120019306/Damned recruits!
2120019307/Mercy! I yield!
2120019308/Any closer and I'll send you to hell.
2120019309/Imbeciles.
2120019310/Follow me! Victory or death!
2120019311/Onward! You only live once!
2120019312/Flaming Rose!
2120019313/Enemies in sight!
2120019314/Waste of words.
2120019315/For the Order!
2120019316/You jest.
2120019317/Milady, allow me to present the sorceress Triss Merigold, and...
2120019318/Enough! Your Highness, allow me to cast this drifter out.
2120019319/Shut your filthy mouth, mutant...
2120019320/Mind your tongue, mutant.
2120019321/Your Highness, he is an aberration...
2120019322/Get out of my sight, freak!
2120019323/On three, we break the door down!
2120019324/We know about your illegal gathering with the elf! Open up or you'll hang!
2120019325/Open up!!! In the name of King Foltest and the Flaming Rose!
2120019326/I'm counting to three! You're screwed, Siegfried!
2120019327/Siegfried! I know you're associating with that witch! You're finished!
2120019328/Open up!!! In the name of King Foltest and the Flaming Rose!
2120019329/The king need not sign every edict! The seal is authentic.
2120019330/You can prove nothing. Surrender and live... Stay out of this, witcher!
2120019331/How dare you accuse me, mongrel?!
2120019332/You'll regret this! You'll all regret it!
2120019333/That scoundrel Thaler, he refuses to abide by a royal edict!
2120019334/We'll all be better off if you do.
2120019335/You'll regret this, witcher!
2120019336/You will not get away with it!
2120019337/Yes! Show yourself a real patriot! Kill that pleb!
2120019338/You chose well, but I suggest you forget what happened here.
2120019339/The royal edict, bearing the very seal of our merciful ruler Foltest, that strips him of his position!
2120019340/Have you made your decision?
2120019341/You dare speak to me?!
2120019342/Witcher! Reveal yourself as an honest man or a coward!
2120019343/By the authority vested in me, et cetera, et cetera, Thaler is hereby dismissed from his position as Head of the Temerian Intelligence Service!
2120019344/He should consider himelf lucky. That bastard deserved to hang...
2120019345/Silence, lice-ridden scab! You'll hang, traitor. Geralt, bring me that pleb. He needn't be in one piece...
2120019346/That was the right decision, witcher.
2120019347/Oh, and forget what you saw here, witcher.
2120019348/That scoundrel should hang! A normal death would be too kind!
2120019349/And others... Loyal civil servants with cleaner reputations than Thaler have been relieved of their posts.
2120019350/You seem not to understand, witcher. We simply follow the king's orders. Fulfill royal edicts.
2120019351/True, a few of the edicts of late appear unpopular, irregular even for Foltest...
2120019352/Yes?
2120019353/I've nothing to say.
2120019354/Even kings make mistakes. Now that we are rid of the rogue, we can tend to the other traitors...
2120019355/Enough! Know your place, witcher!
2120019356/I'm a count. If you've not heard the name De Wett, you must be a simpleton.
2120019357/So I've heard. We could play some time.
2120019358/Impertinent question, but I'll answer.
2120019359/You're clearly too dull minded for poker.
2120019360/Game? Fie. Keep to your sword, wine and women, witcher.
2120019361/I enjoy poker, as a mental exercise.
2120019362/You'll find me here.
2120019363/What is it, witcher?
2120019364/So I think it absurd to delve into the matter of Thaler. This conversation is over.
2120019365/I was covering you. Those imbeciles didn't even crawl from the sewer.
2120019366/We're on the same side.
2120019367/I'm better at catching criminals this way.
2120019368/Vrrraaurgh... Gerralt...
2120019369/Just tell me what you learned.
2120019370/Very well... VRRAAAAAUUUgh!
2120019371/Grraugrrr... Even useful ones?
2120019372/Vrrau. No need.
2120019373/I'm not a monster on the inside - unlike you.
2120019374/The King of Redania? Some support!
2120019375/Thank you. Let us both be on our way...
2120019376/How many have fallen by your sword?
2120019377/Also, the criminals fear this terrible monster that defends the poor.
2120019378/Meaning me.
2120019379/Vrrr... Go away...
2120019380/Grrr... it's me... vrraguh!!
2120019381/I only hunt bandits, rapists, robbers...
2120019382/Vrraugh. Why wouldn't you?
2120019383/It's me, Captain Vincent.
2120019384/Anything else?
2120019385/Surprise, VRRAAUGH!
2120019386/You're not the only ones with informers in the army.
2120019387/I shan't live long. Curse the gods!
2120019388/Step away. I'm sick.
2120019389/Have I a chance to recover?
2120019390/I pray for recovery, but the gods have abandoned us.
2120019391/Mercy upon us, good gentlemen.
2120019392/Help!
2120019393/... heheh, that's what I'll do...
2120019394/...oh, I forgot...
2120019395/I'm tired.
2120019396/You'll only bring trouble.
2120019397/No!
2120019398/Are you daft?!
2120019399/You're different. How interesting.
2120019400/What's that? I'll faint!
2120019401/Ugh, it's drizzling.
2120019402/I hate this weather.
2120019403/I'm sad when it rains.
2120019404/I was drying laundry...
2120019405/Run for your life!
2120019406/Damn I'm tired.
2120019407/Need to get this done.
2120019408/I'm sleepy.
2120019409/No!
2120019410/That's no good to me.
2120019411/Ugh, drizzle.
2120019412/Argh, I detest this weather.
2120019413/I grow sad when it rains.
2120019414/Ugh, I left the laundry out.
2120019415/Help! Mercy!
2120019416/I fear death...
2120019417/Please, have mercy!
2120019418/What was that?
2120019419/To the dogs this world is going.
2120019420/Plenty of that on trash piles.
2120019421/I'm soaked.
2120019422/Rain...
2120019423/My bones hurt.
2120019424/Run for your life!
2120019425/Help!
2120019426/What a day...
2120019427/I'm mad.
2120019428/I'm sleepy.
2120019429/Old and gray but foolish as ever.
2120019430/It's drizzling.
2120019431/I don't like this weather.
2120019432/I get sad when it rains.
2120019433/I think I left the laundry out.
2120019434/Run for your life!
2120019435/My feet are killing me.
2120019436/I need to get this done.
2120019437/I'm sleepy.
2120019438/No!
2120019439/Old, grey and stupid.
2120019440/Ugh, it's drizzling.
2120019441/I don't like this weather.
2120019442/I get sad when it rains.
2120019443/I think I left the laundry out.
2120019444/Run for your life!
2120019445/This outfit's uncomfortable.
2120019446/I shan't disturb you.
2120019447/I could use a nap.
2120019448/No!
2120019449/You are mistaken, Kind Sir.
2120019450/Ugh, it's drizzling.
2120019451/I don't like this weather.
2120019452/It's raining.
2120019453/Huh, it's clearly raining.
2120019454/Help!
2120019455/What a day...
2120019456/I'm mad.
2120019457/I'm sleepy.
2120019458/You'll only bring us trouble.
2120019459/No!
2120019460/Crazy?!
2120019461/What's that? I'm going to faint!
2120019462/Ugh, it's drizzling.
2120019463/I don't like this weather.
2120019464/I get sad when it rains.
2120019465/I think I left the laundry out.
2120019466/I said goons and bandits are about. And monsters at night.
2120019467/My husband wants to be a guard...
2120019468/Hit him with a pan, then tell your brother. Think of your children!
2120019469/Your husband beats you and you tell no one?
2120019470/Hit him with a pan, then tell your brother. Think of your children!
2120019471/Your man beats you and you tell no one?
2120019472/Begone!
2120019473/I go to the swamp and gather herbs by moonlight. But show care, danger lurks...
2120019474/What do you need?
2120019475/If I told, I'd be reduced to beggary and never have a new shawl! Choose what you want and no mischief.
2120019476/Don't be so sure. Mishandle the wrong herb and before you know, the poison's in you. Suddenly, you're foaming at the mouth and the swamp claims another.
2120019477/Herbs, ointments, flowers for the ladies!
2120019478/I'm done for today. Come by tomorrow.
2120019479/You look pale. I have medications for an instant cure. My prices are reasonable.
2120019480/Ointments! Herbs and spices!
2120019481/The rabble now own the streets.
2120019482/This quarter is going to the dogs.
2120019483/How beautiful and virtuous Princess Adda is.
2120019484/Every one would die to be princess.
2120019485/That Siegfried is handsome.
2120019486/De Wett is old.
2120019487/Have you visited that sorceress with the magic ointment?
2120019488/I see her tomorrow.
2120019489/I dreamt my house lay in an icy wasteland.
2120019490/Snow everywhere. And just me, no other humans.
2120019491/Where do those spider-like creatures come from?
2120019492/We need a witcher.
2120019493/Indeed.
2120019494/Bandits don't care about martial law.
2120019495/No, herding nonhumans into the ghetto was wise.
2120019496/He lost his mind.
2120019497/Did you hear about the outskirts?
2120019498/No, some mage killed everyone for revenge.
2120019499/I've not seen your children lately.
2120019500/Why?
2120019501/I fear the epidemic will reach the Trade Quarter.
2120019502/True, elves and dwarves will rot in their own dirt.
2120019503/The Eternal Fire burns for all, even doubters.
2120019504/Jacques de Aldersberg has prayed at the altar of the Eternal Fire for a week.
2120019505/That everyone feel the heat of faith.
2120019506/They say the woodcutters never returned from the swamp.
2120019507/Why did they risk it?
2120019508/The army may close the New Narakort.
2120019509/True.
2120019510/Why so expensive?
2120019511/Expensive and inferior!
2120019512/How much? Did I hear correctly?
2120019513/Watch what you say!
2120019514/Have you seen my children?
2120019515/They shouldn't go there.
2120019516/Indeed.
2120019517/My aunt wrote that the champion cow from Murky Waters died.
2120019518/She didn't say.
2120019519/Look what's happening now.
2120019520/And leave our belongings?
2120019521/Perhaps the rumors of destruction are true?
2120019522/Don't frighten me.
2120019523/The legend doesn't say.
2120019524/And romantic.
2120019525/And the witcher said to the genie:
2120019526/I wish that woman were mine forever!
2120019527/She called me a whore.
2120019528/She fears losing her husband.
2120019529/Who's this Leuvaarden?
2120019530/From Nilfgaard? And he's welcomed here?!
2120019531/That explains much.
2120019532/I've seen no sorcerers lately.
2120019533/More like a bitch.
2120019534/I cannot talk now. M'Lady and Master might summon me at any moment.
2120019535/M'lady doesn't look kindly on me, but my master likes me very much.
2120019536/I come from the province. I'm charmed by Vizima.
2120019537/My mother warned if I served in town strangers would trouble me.
2120019538/Sir, I'm abashed.
2120019539/I mustn't dally. My lady will be cross.
2120019540/My duties call.
2120019541/Leave me in peace.
2120019542/Sir, I'm only a servant.
2120019543/How fortunate that Foltest issues edicts.
2120019544/I thought witchers only inhabited fairy tales.
2120019545/Begone!
2120019546/My neighbor claims Yaevinn vowed revenge because soldiers slew his beloved.
2120019547/Since we drove nonhumans away, the city is more beautiful.
2120019548/I love gazing upon exotic goods.
2120019549/Mind your own business.
2120019550/The whole neighborhood barricaded!
2120019551/This neighborhood grows worse.
2120019552/My husband serves on the council.
2120019553/After establishing a state of emergency, they've run off all the whores.
2120019554/You're new here. You really stand out.
2120019555/I like this place.
2120019556/Be with you in a minute.
2120019557/Make it quick, sweetie, I'm very busy.
2120019558/Don't be so impatient.
2120019559/I'll take your order in a minute.
2120019560/Have a seat. I'll be with you soon.
2120019561/No need for testiness. Let me just tend to something and then I'm all yours.
2120019562/Curses! I spilled the chef's famous white sauce on some dame's red gloves. I sense trouble.
2120019563/I'll tell you a secret you cannot betray... as your reward.
2120019564/These are Wives' Tears. It sobers up the biggest drunkard in an instant.
2120019565/Wonderful! Thank you!
2120019566/How?
2120019567/I won't keep you, but come back soon
2120019568/The two of you could talk about your experiences.
2120019569/You look bored...
2120019570/My grandmother would love you. I think you'd like her, too.
2120019571/Am I wrong? See, I'm right.
2120019572/All respected her, despite her haggy appearance.
2120019573/Or maybe that's why they respected her. Hooked noses can be impressive.
2120019574/That's how it is as a witch. Wisdom doesn't equal respect.
2120019575/5 orens, just for you.
2120019576/Truly you are a darling man.
2120019577/Really?
2120019578/Unfortunately, it's not the first time. I may be out of a job.
2120019579/Yaa. I'll likely end up at the Hairy Bear... Farewell.
2120019580/How can I help you?
2120019581/No explanations. I'm a waitress, the day after is routine.
2120019582/Take a mug of vodka and add two measures of celandine and three of hellebore petals. My grandma's recipe for a hangover cure. Have I told you about my grandma?
2120019583/Do I bore you?
2120019584/I know you're a witcher. That's almost the same as a witch.
2120019585/You practice witchcraft, brew potions, and help women in trouble.
2120019586/I can already imagine my grandmother saying, a measure of celandine, two of hellebore, a pinch of mistletoe.
2120019587/Yes?
2120019588/You don't look too good. Too much to drink?
2120019589/Pity the mirages of the Underwater City disappear when clouds obscure the moon.
2120019590/Some worship fire. Would you pray to a poker?
2120019591/Help!
2120019592/Heeeelp!
2120019593/...The work's hard, the pay's a pittance...
2120019594/I toil too much.
2120019595/I need to rest.
2120019596/You kill monsters for coin?
2120019597/Those swords just for show?
2120019598/White-haired one, I admit I find you...
2120019599/That's useless.
2120019600/Who, the weather's sour.
2120019601/It's pouring.
2120019602/My garden's watered.
2120019603/Storm's come in.
2120019604/Perish, you filthy witcher!
2120019605/Many once made offerings here to the goddess Freya. Some still do, the Eternal Fire have mercy on 'em...
2120019606/Oo! You frightened me. Pray with me?
2120019607/It gives me great solace. The plague stole my son and husband - The Eternal Fire restores my hope. The Reverend warns only the faithful will survive.
2120019608/...in foul times, when brother against brother stands, a terrible darkness will engulf the world. You'll be the light and salvation...
2120019609/Where will they bury me?
2120019610/Please, have mercy!
2120019611/I know I shall die.
2120019612/Oh, that hurts...
2120019613/I hurt no one!
2120019614/What is that supposed to mean?
2120019615/I'm soaked.
2120019616/The chest pain is unbearable.
2120019617/No sense cursing the heavens.
2120019618/I'm getting sicker.
2120019619/Heeeelp!
2120019620/How much longer?...
2120019621/Oh, I work too much.
2120019622/Oh, to rest...
2120019623/Please don't!
2120019624/Are you stupid?
2120019625/The weather's ugly.
2120019626/Quite the rain.
2120019627/I needn't water my garden.
2120019628/Storm's come in.
2120019629/I don't know where this racism originates. My friend Helda is a dwarf and she's nothing like what's said of nonhumans.
2120019630/How rude!
2120019631/My husband doesn't permit me to talk to strangers.
2120019632/Now I wish to see the White Wolf in all his splendor.
2120019633/Drop by for another chat sometime...
2120019634/I've always liked diamonds...
2120019635/That's lovely, witcher.
2120019636/What I really desire is new gloves...
2120019637/Hello, stranger...
2120019638/I heard Rivia is ruled by a wise and strong queen.
2120019639/She was once beautiful, but was wounded during the war. Now her face is scarred.
2120019640/Modern women need knowledge of the world.
2120019641/What would you like to know?
2120019642/Yes. Reputed to be the White Wolf, a dog for sorceresses.
2120019643/How do you know?
2120019644/Really? Is it true witchers can't have children?
2120019645/I feel sorry for them.
2120019646/The bard, Dandelion, claims otherwise.
2120019647/That this witcher had no interest in a normal lass. He only fancied ladies with problems or ones who were abnormal.
2120019648/Moreover, he had difficulties with abnormal ones, too. You've grown pale. Are you okay?
2120019649/Well, yes.
2120019650/He's also a poet - such men don't lie.
2120019651/He had such a sincere face...
2120019652/If you were more handsome, I might mistake you for him.
2120019653/What do you mean?
2120019654/They won't believe this! Gimme a gift I can show my friends!
2120019655/Great idea!
2120019656/Great idea!
2120019657/Really?
2120019658/Are you suggesting I'm spreading false rumors?!
2120019659/I never lie, never!!!
2120019660/Got that?!
2120019661/You tricked me! Get lost.
2120019662/Maybe a bit crude, but yes.
2120019663/I've no interest in those matters.
2120019664/Your secrets are safe with me.
2120019665/That's very kind, but you mentioned a problem...
2120019666/Aaagh... Help, I don't want to die!
2120019667/Aaagh!
2120019668/Yes?
2120019669/Get out, you lousy vagrant. Don't let me see you again.
2120019670/Embrace me...
2120019671/He was to teach me music. One day, Papa returned from the trading post earlier than usual.
2120019672/Why didn't he come himself? Perhaps it's just as well. You look promising too...
2120019673/Am I not good enough for that scoundrel?!
2120019674/No. it's beautiful, very poetic.
2120019675/Papa couldn't understand why the rehearsal was in the nude... He was furious. He pulled an old crossbow from behind the wardrobe. Luckily, his vision isn't what it used to be...
2120019676/Who are you?
2120019677/You again?
2120019678/If I give it to you, he'll use it to serenade some other... victim.
2120019679/If you knew how many tears I've shed for that idiot. Take the lute and go. Leave me to suffer.
2120019680/We were rehearsing the cantata, 'A Bird's Tears.' Papa walked in at the climax.
2120019681/That's all right. I'm terribly bored. Since Papa caught the troubadour Dandelion here, no one sees me.
2120019682/I heard once that a witcher's touch is, umm, special...
2120019683/Then he should bid his lute farewell! Goodbye.
2120019684/I figured. Somehow, he hasn't been singing love songs under my window since father caught us. By the way, I hope you didn't hurt Papa.
2120019685/Why should I give up the lute? After all, Dandelion won't come to see me anymore.
2120019686/Just a moment. What's in it for you? Why are you helping?
2120019687/A friend? Come closer. Fear not, I won't bite.
2120019688/Don't flatter me. I'm no fool. The poetmaster humiliated me. He used me like some lewd wench...
2120019689/I want revenge. I want him to feel what I feel now...
2120019690/Yes! He fell at my feet... He proposed, but I refused...
2120019691/Take the lute and get lost, you impotent man!
2120019692/Nothing. Papa doesn't let me out of the house.
2120019693/Oh my...
2120019694/Papa forbade me from meeting any artists and witchers.
2120019695/A soldier pinched my behind!
2120019696/I'd rather live in the ghetto.
2120019697/Oh, but what her ladies whisper about her!
2120019698/Foolish lasses.
2120019699/I prefer Count de Wett.
2120019700/He's a count! A foreign nobleman!
2120019701/My beauty requires no cosmetics.
2120019702/Oh yeah, you could use a barrel of ointment.
2120019703/And?
2120019704/Strange, my friend had a similar dream.
2120019705/I know not, nor can I fathom why no soldiers have slain them.
2120019706/True. Soldiers only drink and chase tail.
2120019707/Nonhumans?
2120019708/The Scoia'tael should be herded somewhere.
2120019709/They say beasts caused a bloody massacre.
2120019710/Why?
2120019711/I've forbidden them from leaving the house.
2120019712/Depraved soldiers and monsters.
2120019713/These peasant women know no shame.
2120019714/They aim to steal our men!
2120019715/The eastern wind stirs pestilence in the air again.
2120019716/When we all die and crows feast on our remains.
2120019717/We must kindle the Eternal Fire.
2120019718/Seen the herbalist who came from town?
2120019719/Notice her attire? What a harlot!
2120019720/That's where the Beast arose.
2120019721/The plague started there.
2120019722/I merely run it. The shareholders wish to remain anonymous.
2120019723/This business grows more dangerous. I don't plan on rotting in prison.
2120019724/Get out. Now.
2120019725/The soldiers grow more greedy and audacious. Something's afoot. I hope to be away before it occurs.
2120019726/How can I help?
2120019727/Out -- now, or I'll call the boys.
2120019728/Another new face?
2120019729/As do I. Ask such questions and you'll anger a huge organization.
2120019730/You a criminal? This hall exists for decent folk. I fear military law. Perhaps the penalty for what I'm doing is death?
2120019731/King Radovid of Redania will visit Vizima.
2120019732/A brave knight of the Order slew a cockatrice in the sewers.
2120019733/More informers in the crowd. The Royal Master Spy's doing.
2120019734/Begone!
2120019735/Leuvaarden has returned. He's organizing his famous banquets again.
2120019736/Such impertinence!
2120019737/Get to work, witcher! Monsters abound.
2120019738/The guards ogle lasses while bandits overrun the city!
2120019739/Who knows how the plague spreads! I'm even afraid to buy fish!
2120019740/The Butcher of Blaviken came to town. If you see him, run!
2120019741/Some creature ate my neighbor's husband last moon. Yet none take on these monsters...
2120019742/I blame nonhumans for all this trouble!
2120019743/Bastard Mikul made another pass at me.
2120019744/Alvin's a rascal, but I like him.
2120019745/Foolish lasses. Berengar's clearly more handsome than you.
2120019746/How can the Lady of the Lake enrapture all when I possess far more beauty?
2120019747/Oh kind sir...
2120019748/I've been burning fires here to lead him through the mists. Oh, my dear son...
2120019749/Sir, have you seen my son? He has straw-colored hair, freckles on his nose... A child, twelve winters to him...
2120019750/No, they've all gone to Vizima, cursed nonhumans. What did we ever do to them? I found a place nearby where those sons of whores took a human and tortured him.
2120019751/Sir, you see that old church on the hill? The striga lives in the crypt. She awakes at night and roams about in search of blood.
2120019752/But I saw her catch a man once. Horrifying.
2120019753/They buried the poor soul up to his neck and covered his head in syrup. Nearby was an anthill, with red ants as big as your thumb...
2120019754/Once, she came for me. I didn't run, for I light this fire to guide my son through the night. The monster hesitated, then ran on. Since then, she has avoided me.
2120019755/Thank you! Here's your payment.
2120019756/We're counting on you!
2120019757/Ah, yes! You slew the cemetaurs? You have five jaws to prove it?
2120019758/Something is rotten in the state of Temeria. Time to emigrate.
2120019759/They burned my house down, destroyed all my property. What shall I do?
2120019760/I'm going to Redania, where they've tamed the nonhumans.
2120019761/Where was the king when this began?
2120019762/I'll never give a nonhuman another job.
2120019763/What did I do to you?
2120019764/Stop him!
2120019765/I definitely should...
2120019766/No, impossible...
2120019767/Curious...
2120019768/I prefer something useful.
2120019769/Just what we needed.
2120019770/Worse, it's raining...
2120019771/Might as well be raining toads.
2120019772/It's raining cats and dogs!
2120019773/Well, well, a witcher for the monsters.
2120019774/I fish, so I know how a man feels after such a catch.
2120019775/Did the job.
2120019776/Why? What did I do?
2120019777/*sigh*
2120019778/Stop him!
2120019779/I should definitely do that...
2120019780/No, impossible...
2120019781/What's that?
2120019782/Curious...
2120019783/Huh?
2120019784/Oh my...
2120019785/Interesting...
2120019786/*yawn*
2120019787/*grunt*
2120019788/I did nothing!
2120019789/This is useless.
2120019790/Just what we needed.
2120019791/And it's raining...
2120019792/It's raining frogs.
2120019793/Raining cats and dogs.
2120019794/It could stop raining!
2120019795/It rains, it pours.
2120019796/Why? I didn't do anything!
2120019797/*sigh*
2120019798/Stop him!
2120019799/I should definitely do that...
2120019800/No, impossible...
2120019801/What's that?
2120019802/Curious...
2120019803/Huh?
2120019804/Oh my...
2120019805/Interesting...
2120019806/*yawn*
2120019807/*grunt*
2120019808/What did I do?
2120019809/Stop pestering me.
2120019810/Just what we needed.
2120019811/And it's raining...
2120019812/It's raining frogs.
2120019813/A real downpour!
2120019814/It could stop raining!
2120019815/Rain, rain.
2120019816/Why? I didn't do anything!
2120019817/*sigh*
2120019818/Stop him!
2120019819/I should definitely do that...
2120019820/No, impossible...
2120019821/What's that?
2120019822/Curious...
2120019823/Huh?
2120019824/Oh my...
2120019825/Interesting...
2120019826/*yawn*
2120019827/*grunt*
2120019828/What did I do?
2120019829/You'll gain nothing that way.
2120019830/Just what we needed.
2120019831/Rain, great...
2120019832/Oo, it's raining toads.
2120019833/Raining cats and dogs.
2120019834/It could stop raining!
2120019835/It rains, it pours.
2120019836/What did I do to you?
2120019837/Stop him!
2120019838/I should try that...
2120019839/Impossible...
2120019840/Curious...
2120019841/No use even trying.
2120019842/And now, it's raining...
2120019843/It's raining cats and dogs!
2120019844/It could stop raining!
2120019845/It rains and it pours.
2120019846/Rumors say quarantine'll last while the plague rages. &#13;
2120019847/I'm off to the castle gate. The peddler there sells great bread.
2120019848/All nonhumans are the same.
2120019849/There're more massacres in the nonhuman quarter.
2120019850/Lebioda's Hospital is really cramped.
2120019851/Do all new plague cases end up in Old Vizima?
2120019852/Indeed. It's horrific... Time they devised a remedy.
2120019853/I pray each day. My brother works there.
2120019854/Times're growing scary.
2120019855/How so?
2120019856/Monsters climb from nowhere and bandits use the quarantine to rip us off.
2120019857/We barricade our door at night.
2120019858/If I were you, I'd avoid the streets at night.
2120019859/Those nonhuman thieves should be expelled from the city!
2120019860/Begone!
2120019861/This accursed disease will kill us all.
2120019862/Look, a witcher.
2120019863/Bitch's son.
2120019864/Salamanders visit you, too?
2120019865/Did you complain to town hall?
2120019866/Best to wait it out.
2120019867/No, as usual.
2120019868/Some scoundrel tried to sell me fisstech.
2120019869/No wonder they instituted martial law.
2120019870/Yaevinn has entered the city!
2120019871/They say he's murdering those who threatened nonhumans.
2120019872/So... do they pay well?
2120019873/They call you a spy for the court.
2120019874/You nose around and then inform.
2120019875/How goes?
2120019876/The same.
2120019877/Perhaps this Eternal Fire provides more than it seems.
2120019878/No, simply pondering.
2120019879/Not sure I like this.
2120019880/Why martial law only in our district?
2120019881/Perhaps, but these impertinent soldiers lack respect.
2120019882/I feel like leaving this city.
2120019883/I fear some ill lies on the horizon.
2120019884/Was Yaevinn slain during the swamp skirmishes?
2120019885/Fortune seems to favor evil.
2120019886/The Wild Hunt appeared above the city.
2120019887/Perhaps the phantom king and his court are pursuing someone.
2120019888/I'd find a knife in my gut.
2120019889/Who rules this city? Salamandra or us?
2120019890/The soldiers behave just like bandits.
2120019891/If the customs war with Redania continues, we'll all lose.
2120019892/Enough. At least the Black Ones no longer drown us in cheap goods.
2120019893/Extortion.
2120019894/I wouldn't pay half that!
2120019895/These prices are barbarous!
2120019896/These goods couldn't cost so much.
2120019897/Bastard.
2120019898/Burn in hell!
2120019899/Destruction is coming!
2120019900/The rats are leaving the neighborhood.
2120019901/I saw them fleeing, with my own eyes!
2120019902/At home, he learned his fiancée was to bear a child none expected!
2120019903/He had to, according to the Law of Surprise.
2120019904/Then the witcher said to the man he saved...
2120019905/Grant me what you don't expect to find at home.
2120019906/My tooth hurts.
2120019907/They moved the blacksmith to the ghetto.
2120019908/I just have a bad feeling.
2120019909/I'm upset.
2120019910/I fear some ill will befall us all.
2120019911/You look pale. How do you feel?
2120019912/Perhaps that pestilence from the ghetto?
2120019913/Possibly. Though pious, the knights often use mercenaries.
2120019914/Supposedly someone dealt with the bandits.
2120019915/Some mercenary.
2120019916/Have you played that foreign game with dice?
2120019917/Where do you find dice?
2120019918/Bad luck. Unless luck isn't involved...
2120019919/I must go. My wife is worried.
2120019920/An excellent idea this place was. I spend all my free time here.
2120019921/I love winning.
2120019922/Go away. Witchers bring ill fortune.
2120019923/I haven't lost everything! Two more hands and I'll be on a roll again.
2120019924/Unlucky at cards today.
2120019925/Get out of here.
2120019926/The more this place is known, the sooner the army will visit.
2120019927/Why are you here?
2120019928/What fortune... Our monster problems multiply.
2120019929/Wherever you turn, you find new followers of the Eternal Fire.
2120019930/Damnable nonhumans seized goods from the warehouse. They must need gold.
2120019931/Sweet leisure.
2120019932/At last, some respite.
2120019933/In three hours, they've taken three lunch breaks and served three people.
2120019934/Such bureaucracy proves our monarch has ceded power to "interest groups" - we all know who...
2120019935/Damn all these officials!
2120019936/When will this end?
2120019937/I'm done waiting.
2120019938/Protest at town hall! End the lines!
2120019939/I don't know how to write - how can I sign the accursed paper?!
2120019940/Bureaucracy breeds corruption!
2120019941/But the legend...
2120019942/Besides, I prefer to use my bow. One day, I'll enter a tournament in Vizima.
2120019943/Greetings, sir.
2120019944/Mhm. May I ask something?
2120019945/Can a basilisk be defeated with a mirror?
2120019946/All right, si... I mean, Geralt.
2120019947/Tis a true honor, si... Geralt.
2120019948/I can't talk now.
2120019949/Best in the village. I can hit an apple at fifty paces!
2120019950/Not really... When my father refurbished our hut, the doors wouldn't close. The stairs are such that even the cat fears them and when it rains...
2120019951/Yes?
2120019952/A customer!
2120019953/Rarely do any buy arms in Murky Waters. I'm no salesman like my father.
2120019954/Perhaps... I'm to sit quiet and sell to those who want to buy.
2120019955/My father told me to sell arms. But if no one buys... uh, but better not to argue with father.
2120019956/Father, I'd like the day off tomorrow... No?...
2120019957/My tooth aches...
2120019958/Father, what are you doing?
2120019959/I feel the heat from here.
2120019960/Can I go?
2120019961/Father, why so silent?
2120019962/I found a mangled corpse at the crossroads...
2120019963/Where's the help the Order promised?
2120019964/Greetings. Others stricken by war have sought shelter here.
2120019965/To other cellars... and an exit eventually, I assume. But I cannot guarantee it is safe.
2120019966/Quickly, get inside!
2120019967/The key should be somewhere in this house.
2120019968/Try the door in the cellar...
2120019969/Stay if you please. Outside war and death march hand in hand.
2120019970/Come inside, it's safer.
2120019971/So you're among those who have chosen to trust the Eternal Fire? Hm. There's no sense in going out in the street again, you'll perish.
2120019972/We must laugh at death, that rotten whore.
2120019973/Enjoy yourselves while you're still able...
2120019974/Don't blame me!
2120019975/Great idea...
2120019976/What should I get her?...
2120019977/Good deal...
2120019978/What brings you here? Never mind...
2120019979/Great trophy, but hide it from women.
2120019980/Armed madman! Help!
2120019981/What's with you?
2120019982/How I hate this weather.
2120019983/What a downpour.
2120019984/Some serious rain.
2120019985/Argh... rain...
2120019986/A witcher! Hide your women!
2120019987/No reason to be here, white-haired one.
2120019988/I'm not to blame!
2120019989/Great idea...
2120019990/...what can I get her?...
2120019991/Interesting...
2120019992/An armed madman! Help!
2120019993/Shove off with an offer like that.
2120019994/I hate this weather.
2120019995/What a downpour.
2120019996/Ugh, some serious rain...
2120019997/Argh... rain...
2120019998/Mmmmmhm, seems so. Maybe we need a witcher to look into it.
2120019999/What is it?
2120020000/Yeees?
2120020001/Deal! I'll return here at midnight.
2120020002/Wine?! Couldn't pass for wine's step-brother!
2120020003/I know where to find fine spirit, but it requires a sword to get it.
2120020004/Take the gate leading to the Dike. On the right it leads to the canal. The house is on the left.
2120020005/How can they drink this? What is it anyway?
2120020006/Splendid. I have no coin, though. Drank it all away... I'll keep one bottle, you take the rest for your toil...
2120020007/The wine cellar is in a house where monsters now haunt.
2120020008/What?! You cheat. Leave me be!
2120020009/I live in the Trade Quarter, but the inns there are closed. Want to earn some coin?
2120020010/I know a place with hundred-year-old wine from Toussaint.
2120020011/I knew you to be a decent man.
2120020012/Ah, to see the vineyards of Toussaint.
2120020013/Still waiting. Suspected you were a braggart.
2120020014/I knew I couldn't trust a witcher.
2120020015/Diluted dog's piss. Thus I come here rarely.
2120020016/No word from Yaren again. Where's my wood?
2120020017/Raftsmen are lazy.
2120020018/I don't need a guard.
2120020019/Best watch out for Redanians, damned thieves.
2120020020/I always end up depending on myself.
2120020021/My Cintrian porcelain! Smashed to bits!
2120020022/The bandits with Salamander badges demanded gold for protection.
2120020023/Leave me!
2120020024/I can't work with idiots.
2120020025/If I were you, I'd avoid the streets at night.
2120020026/Corruption abounds! Where have law and justice gone?
2120020027/Begone!
2120020028/Avert your gaze. He'll enchant you with his evil eye.
2120020029/Quiet, he hears better than any cat.
2120020030/They insisted I be blind and deaf to their doings.
2120020031/Are you mad? Those ruffians own town hall.
2120020032/I stumble over fisstech more than dog manure.
2120020033/Will that help?
2120020034/Impossible!
2120020035/So watch what you say.
2120020036/Pennies, really.
2120020037/Slander!
2120020038/Vile calumnies!
2120020039/Poor as ever. And you?
2120020040/As I thought.
2120020041/You a convert?
2120020042/I'll never renounce the old gods.
2120020043/To protect the notables living here.
2120020044/Better them than those ninny city guards.
2120020045/I've taken my children to the countryside.
2120020046/So do I.
2120020047/Merely a rumor.
2120020048/Everyone gets their due.
2120020049/Bad news. The Wild Hunt portends tragedy and war.
2120020050/If so, I pity that unfortunate soul.
2120020051/True, those bandits have a long arm.
2120020052/You forgot the army.
2120020053/Speak before the city council.
2120020054/If Nilfgaard pressures us, we'll be whining like piglets.
2120020055/Still, Foltest should raise duties on goods from the south.
2120020056/Probably read it.
2120020057/Always a bit dim, that one.
2120020058/So where'd he get the idea?
2120020059/Later.
2120020060/No.
2120020061/I have business.
2120020062/Soon. I've found a great business deal.
2120020063/Not so! Merely a matter of time...
2120020064/Right.
2120020065/Hmm.
2120020066/Then we'll witness assassinations again.
2120020067/The Order busies itself with nonhumans.
2120020068/What do they call these monsters?
2120020069/Where do they come from?
2120020070/Do you expect war?
2120020071/Inflation.
2120020072/I worry prices will continue to rise.
2120020073/How goes business?
2120020074/I regret not investing in your enterprise.
2120020075/Scoundrel.
2120020076/Quiet, whore's son.
2120020077/Nonsense. Martial law doesn't mean annihilation.
2120020078/So you think.
2120020079/But why would they run?
2120020080/Did he surrender the child?
2120020081/What?
2120020082/And then?
2120020083/Pull it out.
2120020084/What the hell.
2120020085/Relax.
2120020086/How, with the army defending us?
2120020087/Not well.
2120020088/Don't frighten me.
2120020089/Let's wish him success.
2120020090/Royal folk?
2120020091/Hah! I wager the Order hired him.
2120020092/It's terribly addictive.
2120020093/No idea. I borrow mine.
2120020094/Damnit, don't bother me at a moment like this.
2120020095/My luck must turn after midnight.
2120020096/Someone's cheating at this table. You know who you are...
2120020097/Ha, you're the one on the warpath with the Order. You know they're watching you?
2120020098/We don't associate with elven collaborators.
2120020099/Some army. More ruffians than ever and the number of virgins declines sharply.
2120020100/If they stop me one more time at the barricade...
2120020101/Burgomaster Velerad has supposedly taken to drink.
2120020102/I spotted the sorceress Merigold. Though a witch, she's so beautiful...
2120020103/I heard a witcher lifted the curse of the striga from Princess Adda.
2120020104/Have you heard the price of a measure of salt?!
2120020105/The price of sulfur's dropping because of the trade war with Redania.
2120020106/None supply wood to the city. That spells war with the dryads of Brokilon.
2120020107/Have you heard the prices they demand?!
2120020108/I dislike you.
2120020109/Prices grow so monstrous a witcher should slash them.
2120020110/You're Geralt from Rivia. You slew the dragon from Quartz Mountain.
2120020111/I have a valuable book.
2120020112/White Wolf. Spare a moment?
2120020113/I hope you'll utilize it to solve problems in this neighborhood. Plus, my account with Leuvaarden will be cleared.
2120020114/My friends from the Monastic neighborhood spoke well of you.
2120020115/Every day, the militia takes greater control of the neighborhood.
2120020116/The military meddles in the affairs of the guilds and the city council.
2120020117/I'll enlist in the army.
2120020118/How true the saying: you want justice, hire a witcher.
2120020119/Perhaps I'll enlist in the Order's army. They pay you to have fun with elves.
2120020120/If not for monsters and bandits, this city would be without equal.
2120020121/All complain about Foltest, but wait until Adda ascends to the throne.
2120020122/Mikul's a detestable fool!
2120020123/I only believe in the Eternal Fire.
2120020124/That thief's bugging me.
2120020125/Shut your trap! I'm busy...
2120020126/I said, shut up!
2120020127/Take your belongings from the trunk before I sell them. And remember the reward on the cockatrice's head. Vincent gets very excited about trophies.
2120020128/You killed the cockatrice! On behalf of King Foltest, I grant you an official pardon.
2120020129/I feel I could single-handedly stop a cavalry charge!
2120020130/The sword... where was it...
2120020131/Yes. We also confiscated a potion. Once you've completed your task, collect your belongings from behind the bars.
2120020132/Stupid. The Professor just does the wet work. If you want to be effective, you'd strike at his boss.
2120020133/Though I doubt you'd succeed. He's a big player. He has... concessions...
2120020134/First you gotta survive your meeting with the cockatrice.
2120020135/Your predecessor just disappeared. It's your turn to face the cockatrice in the sewers.
2120020136/Here's the silver sword. I can't return your other belongings - you'd be too dangerous to handle. However, you can have this potion. You'll know how to use it.
2120020137/He said he'd manage with his fists. Good luck. You'll get your belongings when you return.
2120020138/I never turn down good fisstech...
2120020139/But... ah-choo! I hardly know anything.
2120020140/They took him to Lebioda Hospital.
2120020141/Ahh-choo!
2120020142/Maybe, but not today.
2120020143/Thaler, the fence - has to earn his living somehow. Before we let the Professor out, Thaler and Vincent were chatting in the courtyard.
2120020144/I'll mark the place on your map. But don't kill him. We have a deal with him.
2120020145/Ah-choo! Damn, it's strong...
2120020146/None of your business.
2120020147/Aaaaahhh-chooooooo!
2120020148/He has powerful friends. Let that be a warning - don't annoy those more powerful than you.
2120020149/Hey! You're still under observation. Besides, someone bailed him out. Completely legal.
2120020150/No idea... Money was transferred from Vivaldi's dwarven bank... Impossible to trace. Drop it, I could get in trouble talking like this.
2120020151/No chance. Anyone arrested for dealing with Scoia'tael is a political prisoner.
2120020152/Why are you standing up for him?
2120020153/Pay the two hundred bail and I'll let him out. You can do whatever you want, then.
2120020154/Why would I tell you...? Hmph, the captain would kill me.
2120020155/There's also payments for Salamander badges taken from dead bandits.
2120020156/Be glad you're not doing extra time for it. We've confiscated it - don't mention it to the captain.
2120020157/Heheheh, you're pretty green... sniff.
2120020158/It's not royal gold. Privately funded.
2120020159/Ask.
2120020160/Powder would help...
2120020161/Ah, I can finally relax. I'll inspect what we've confiscated here. Hmm, good quality gear...
2120020162/They help friends. Take this ring and they'll bother you no more,
2120020163/Haha. If you buy fisstech from Coleman at the Hairy Bear, don't say I sent you.
2120020164/Where?
2120020165/I can't tell you, but the sponsor's representative spends his evenings at the tavern...
2120020166/The one we found at Thaler's?
2120020167/Hey! The sewers are through the trapdoor.
2120020168/You? Ah-choo! We must speak.
2120020169/An informer spoke of a dealer called Angus who holds some powder. He works in the slums.
2120020170/Ah-choo! This is how it works: I describe a job - if you refuse, it's the dungeon for you.
2120020171/Excellent, ah-choo! You need only follow it.
2120020172/Gamble?!
2120020173/A little edgy today, are we? Listen, I know the people with the Salamander badge have long been after you. *Ah-choo!* I know where they can be found. Deal with them and your problems are over. And, in the process, you'll help me out, too... How about it?
2120020174/Salamandra has nearly taken control of the drug trade. If no one stands against them...
2120020175/They're after you! Destroy them, take the information you need, and return here. Oh, and gather any drugs you find as evidence.
2120020176/We must know where he gets his goods. He's often at the tavern.
2120020177/Strange - admitting to a guard you killed a human.
2120020178/I jest. Ah-choo! You've done well. Ah-choo! Now take your payment and go. Ah-choo!
2120020179/Me? I don't get it.
2120020180/Okay, don't worry. I'm a law enforcement officer.
2120020181/Right. Do you have the juices?
2120020182/Splendid. Here's the gold.
2120020183/Yeah. Deal with those monsters or it's my problem.
2120020184/Haven't slept in five days, but I feel good as new!
2120020185/Naah, it's not unlike swimming in buttermilk.
2120020186/What is it?
2120020187/Get ready, Geralt.
2120020188/As a bell. But we still must deal with Gellert...
2120020189/Good work, witcher. A few people died, but I'll turn a blind eye.
2120020190/Well done. The community is better without their kind. Back to business. Where hides the fisstech producer?
2120020191/Great. I will secure the evidence and the drugs. *Ah-choo!* For the public good, of course. You deal with Gellert.
2120020192/What riles you? You got all you wanted!
2120020193/You're in the way. We're securing evidence... Ah-choo!
2120020194/I'm waiting to hear about your progress.
2120020195/Go away!
2120020196/Quiet. They'll hear...
2120020197/I'll die anyway. They'll find me, they'll get me.
2120020198/Through the window.
2120020199/A third of the land will be consumed by fire...
2120020200/This foreboding will ever linger. We remember what was, to know what will be.
2120020201/The Age of the Wolf's Blizzard approaches, the Age of the Sword and Axe.
2120020202/I wanna live!
2120020203/Help!
2120020204/Uhh, no...
2120020205/...I best go...
2120020206/What the hell?
2120020207/Witchers bring nothing good.
2120020208/No thank you.
2120020209/This weather...
2120020210/What a downpour!
2120020211/Don't expect much gold for killing a monster!
2120020212/Watch your step.
2120020213/Brrr...
2120020214/Hard rain, no?
2120020215/I wanna live!
2120020216/Help!
2120020217/Uhh, no...
2120020218/...yes....
2120020219/...I'd better go...
2120020220/You must be mistaken.
2120020221/It's raining.
2120020222/What a downpour!
2120020223/Brrr... it's wet.
2120020224/It's raining hard.
2120020225/Have you heard rumors of bandits?
2120020226/Abduction? A fool's tale.
2120020227/I'd give my seven children away for a fair price...
2120020228/The Beast has struck again.
2120020229/The loan shark who lived by the bridge, tore him to bits.
2120020230/The Beast summoned its ghostly servants. The cries were heard throughout the village.
2120020231/Or the witch cursed him.
2120020232/Haren has elven jewelry in stock again.
2120020233/The bastard grows wealthy off our coin.
2120020234/He'll get his due.
2120020235/Reverend said we weren't praying enough.
2120020236/We must erect more chapels to the Eternal Fire.
2120020237/When will the city gates open?
2120020238/What makes them better?
2120020239/Let's pray the knights arrive soon.
2120020240/The Beast has struck again.
2120020241/Damn those bloodhounds!
2120020242/I hope I never encounter one.
2120020243/How might I help?
2120020244/Enjoy the pheasant tongues.
2120020245/I once lived in Vizima, but poverty drove me to the fringes.
2120020246/I'm not talking...
2120020247/If I have but a slim chance of gaining equal rights for nonhumans, I must risk it. Yet I wonder what prompted Foltest to negotiate. True, we have been successful in Vizima, but all out victory remains a distant goal...
2120020248/How do you know?
2120020249/Also, the king sent someone to negotiate. He doubtless desires to remove or bribe me...
2120020250/Wolf...
2120020251/I came as quickly as I could!
2120020252/Greetings, White Wolf.
2120020253/The main gate is closed. But I know another route.
2120020254/Unbelievably good. We've inflicted heavy losses on the Order. They've been forced to regroup.
2120020255/There's no time to lose. You must stop your enemies. Quickly, they're coming!
2120020256/We'll watch your back. More mutants approach.
2120020257/A stone well. If you squeeze through, you can reach the lower levels of the Old Manor. Let me show you.
2120020258/Follow me.
2120020259/Find what you wanted?
2120020260/No look of satisfaction?
2120020261/Wolf, you're alive.
2120020262/True. I have a boat at the landing. Join me when you're ready.
2120020263/I'm not surprised.
2120020264/Yes. Vizima in revolt awaits...
2120020265/Quick, grab the line and descend.
2120020266/No. You must've heard it too.
2120020267/Greetings, Geralt! I feared we would be too late, until I heard something like the roar of a polar tiger...
2120020268/Bloede Dh'oine!
2120020269/And if those long-eared bastards cease, can they then, as fighters for freedom and decency, count on the king's clemency, or even amnesty?
2120020270/Then let us speak to your king.
2120020271/I'm certain. Humans live brief lives, like mayflies. They're not likely to surprise me, whether king or poet. No offense, Dandelion.
2120020272/The king will be forced to acknowledge me as a temporary ally.
2120020273/To get to the cloister, we must pass through the sewers. The entrance lies nearby.
2120020274/They pray instead of fighting fires... Dh'oine.
2120020275/Hm, many elves mourn today, too...
2120020276/The quarter is burning. We're too late.
2120020277/Worse. A zeugl, probably grown fat on carrion.
2120020278/We must hurry!
2120020279/The Order reveals its true face.
2120020280/Bloede arse! He got me...
2120020281/We must hurry!
2120020282/As I knew from the start. You saw as I did, Geralt.
2120020283/Go on, the Scoia'tael will care for me. Kill that bastard De Aldersberg. Go!
2120020284/Years of struggle have born bitter fruit.
2120020285/Geralt, if I die...
2120020286/With a zeugl in the sewers, any professional advice?
2120020287/No indeed. Let's put this corpse to rest.
2120020288/Silence, traitor. You've delivered death too often. Retribution awaits.
2120020289/Look into my eyes, dh'oine, and you will see your death...
2120020290/I was wrong about you. You're not worth talking to. You're a blind, rabid dog biting anything that moves. Someone needs to finish you off.
2120020291/Die, dh'oine!
2120020292/Toruviel is dead. I know enough to blame you for her death. You certainly played a part.
2120020293/So you live... The sight of you sickens me.
2120020294/Don't you dare defile her name, dh'oine!
2120020295/Humans, elves, dwarves - we all hate, we all kill... This cannot go on... Va fail, Wolf...
2120020296/Leave me be.
2120020297/De Aldersberg has gone mad, released his experiments on the city...
2120020298/For that is what you are. No wolf, but a rabid dog, a mindless killing machine. Nobody.
2120020299/Now I shall kill you like the dog you are.
2120020300/Yet we were right. Behold, humans are naught but bloodthirsty apes. That is plainly visible here.
2120020301/We could have stopped the Grand Master's madness, but you insisted on stopping us.
2120020302/You blindly followed the Order's lead and now brandish your sword against them, like a dog biting the hand that feeds it.
2120020303/You're obsolete, the world has no use for you. Lay down your sword and rest, Geralt.
2120020304/We fought for those we love. You scorn that for you'll never understand it.
2120020305/Die!
2120020306/Perish!
2120020307/You die today!
2120020308/You shall not lift your hand against me!
2120020309/For freedom!
2120020310/Die!
2120020311/Finally, you've arrived.
2120020312/Death to the dh'oine!
2120020313/The elven star rises!
2120020314/Lara Dorren!
2120020315/You annoy me!
2120020316/Witcher, I wish to have a word with you.
2120020317/Our time is now! At them!
2120020318/Fall back! Retreat!
2120020319/That's not quite what I had in mind, witcher.
2120020320/That maggot must die!
2120020321/Die!
2120020322/Perish!
2120020323/Meet your death!
2120020324/You shall not lift your hand against me!
2120020325/Freedom!
2120020326/Die!
2120020327/Finally, you've arrived.
2120020328/Death to all dh'oine!
2120020329/The elven star rises!
2120020330/For Aelirenn!
2120020331/Fight!
2120020332/Witcher, I wish to have a word with you.
2120020333/Our time is now! At them!
2120020334/Retreat! Fall back!
2120020335/That knave must die!
2120020336/That's not quite what I had in mind, witcher.
2120020337/You know more than you're willing to reveal. I don't trust you, monster slayer.
2120020338/For the pain of others and our own!
2120020339/Are you speaking from experience, monster slayer?
2120020340/Hmm... Let us pray beneath the trees.
2120020341/I'd be obliged if you could deliver it to Vivaldi, a dwarf living in town, and then return his reply to me.
2120020342/Who sent you?
2120020343/Marvelous place. I come here when I need to think, and the peacefulness helps clear my mind. Even a witcher is welcome here.
2120020344/Sarcasm only serves to expose your inhibitions.
2120020345/Welcome to the Druids' Grove, traveler.
2120020346/I spent decades among humans. I find your kind as complicated as the schematics of a flail.
2120020347/For the trampled heather,
2120020348/Sadly, no. But your kind often meet a sudden end...
2120020349/Yes?
2120020350/My name's Yaevinn.
2120020351/Indeed, he has. He was interested in the tower's history, in legends. He scarcely seemed the intellectual, so another must've sent him.
2120020352/Then I'll ask you a favor. I need a letter delivered to Vizima, where I'm not welcome. As a witcher, you should find little difficulty tending to monsters on the way and avoiding trouble with the guards at the city gates.
2120020353/For death inflicted by sword!
2120020354/For fate that has been destroyed!
2120020355/For blood that has been shed,
2120020356/Thank you.
2120020357/Correction, we aim to win the war we're fighting, not start an uprising. And worry about your informing on us? A nonhuman yourself, humans will take you no more seriously than they do us. And even if they do listen, we are prepared, so well, in fact, that nothing can stop us. Vizima will burn soon.
2120020358/NOT_USED
2120020359/I conducted a little investigation into that witcher who roamed the swamp before you.
2120020360/Yes. He was seized by dh'oine wearing the Salamandra sign. Apparently, he offered no resistance.
2120020361/I trust you won't fail me.
2120020362/Don't tell me you're having second thoughts. Why are you still here?
2120020363/Down to business. I have a job for you.
2120020364/Vivaldi's an intelligent player. Do you really think he believes that possible? Imagine the Temerian gentry and King Foltest returning lands they took from us with fire and sword. Imagine them accepting nonhumans as equals...
2120020365/Interesting. The bank functions, yet Vivaldi is bankrupt. Thank you, Geralt. I have an idea...
2120020366/I must admit you amuse me, but I shan't mock you. I'll also refrain from correcting your reasoning. But think how the humans you protect treat you. Do they deserve your loyalty?
2120020367/Maybe he foresaw their coming. Look out for yourself, Gwyn'bleidd.
2120020368/If not for other circumstances, our conversation would be drastically different now.
2120020369/NOT_USED
2120020370/NOT_USED
2120020371/NOT_USED
2120020372/We must train to fight effectively.
2120020373/Can a few stones turn into an avalanche? Can an entire city burn down from just one spark? No need to answer, we both know the truth.
2120020374/Ah, witcher.
2120020375/NOT_USED
2120020376/They're heavily armored, you'd best prepare. I heard witchers augment their fighting prowess with potions...
2120020377/Bloede dh'oine! Curse you, witcher! Wherever you go, death follows you. Begone before I lose my temper.
2120020378/He sends words not gold. I suspected as much.
2120020379/Quite the contrary, witcher. Vivaldi either will not or cannot help us, crucial information regardless. Did he say why he refused?
2120020380/Any losses?
2120020381/We'll acquire weapons. The dh'oine will come for our gold. Most importantly, the Order has been beaten. You will hear of me yet.
2120020382/NOT_USED
2120020383/Yes?
2120020384/Ha! I don't know myself what to make of all this, as King Dezmod said when caught cheating at cards...
2120020385/I assume you were victorious. I'm highly pleased, witcher. Here is your reward.
2120020386/Naive as a child. You'll find it impossible to remain neutral in a war.
2120020387/Sarcasm is no protection against swords. You'll understand that in time.
2120020388/I'd like you to lead the unit to the Golem Burial Ground, where hav'caaren await with a weapons shipment. If matters turn dire, I expect you to prevent the unit from dispersing.
2120020389/I'm gratified. Hawkers, as humans call them, supply weapons to our units. Waste no more time. The unit is ready. May your footsteps be soft, your breathing relaxed, and fight bravely.
2120020390/You put your otherness on display, but I see nothing but a small, lousy dh'oine like all the rest. I've no time for you, vort!
2120020391/Vort!
2120020392/NOT_USED
2120020393/Hm. You proved apt at moving around the swamp and performed a favor for us. There is something...
2120020394/I've heard that knights of the Order of the Flaming Rose have entered the swamp. Those fanatics detest nonhumans. They'll come for us sooner or later.
2120020395/Knowing you, we'll doubtless meet in battle. Question is: which side will you choose?
2120020396/None of your concern, witcher. But you're no fool. Think hard, perhaps you'll figure it out.
2120020397/I'm under the impression that someone is protecting you. And I don't mean the gods.
2120020398/Did anyone give you problems?
2120020399/Did you want something, Wolf?
2120020400/Vizima is heavily guarded... but for you I'll find a way. See you there, Wolf.
2120020401/When and where, Wolf?
2120020402/To be frank, Geralt, any concession gained, even the tiniest right, would be a victory. Somehow the process must begin and I'd rather see it happen now.
2120020403/I need time. We'll meet there.
2120020404/Do you think I want to get killed? I wouldn't risk my life and weeks of torture for mere amusement. And that's what awaits me if I am caught.
2120020405/Hmmm, I can't say I'm keen to see that happen, but since you helped me...
2120020406/And Vivaldi got his bank back, or will soon...
2120020407/They're also dh'oine, but they bother me more than most. What did you have in mind?
2120020408/Welcome, Wolf.
2120020409/Teleportation, Wolf. Thanks to the stone you comandeered...
2120020410/You finally arrive, Wolf.
2120020411/Quiet! I hear footsteps!
2120020412/Under certain conditions, dh'oine.
2120020413/Sorceress, teleport us now! My unit is ready.
2120020414/That's the final point we need to decide...
2120020415/He's here.
2120020416/There's no time! Open the portal and let my unit in.
2120020417/Gwynbleidd! We have no time to lose!
2120020418/Geralt! Are you all right?!
2120020419/A powerful spell... from the book you found in the swamp.
2120020420/The Professor escaped, and that barrier blocks our path!
2120020421/She stayed behind to deal with that lunatic De Wett. She told me to warn you that Azar has gained immense power thanks to some book...
2120020422/The Salamanders enter their base through a magic portal created years ago by my kin.
2120020423/You took a mighty blow... It's fortunate you're still alive.
2120020424/You took a mighty blow... The spell must have protected you...
2120020425/Gwynbleidd, my brothers-in-arms await. Would you take on the entire Salamandra base yourself?
2120020426/There's not time to lose, Gwynnbleidd!
2120020427/She stayed behind to deal with that lunatic De Wett. But she cast Alzur's Shield before teleporting you...
2120020428/Triss claims it can be activated using a Power Stone. Luckily, there's one there - on the right. Unfortunately, it's guarded by a mage.
2120020429/Though a blizzard raged through the night, spring suddenly appeared on that hill and feainnewedd bloomed. Now those flowers grow only in Dol Blathanna and where Lara breathed her last.
2120020430/I have a mission for you, one not entirely related to the struggle for freedom...
2120020431/Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal was an elven sorceress, an Aen Saevherne, a Knowing One. She carried Hen Ichaer, Elder Blood, which puzzles even us elves.
2120020432/We suffocate in the shackles placed upon us by our human oppressors...
2120020433/We have learned that the ruins of an elven temple have been found in the sewers beneath Vizima. Not surprising given the city was erected on elven foundations. We think Lara Dorren may have been there and may have left something behind.
2120020434/Finish what I first requested. Then we'll talk.
2120020435/She fled the city, sought shelter in a forest. When night descended and the frosts came, Lara faded on a hill amidst the trees. She gave birth to a daughter whom she protected with what warmth remained in her waning body.
2120020436/When Lara, begging mercy not for her but for her unborn child, grabbed the door of the royal carriage, at the king's behest a man-at-arms lashed out with his cutlass, severing her fingers.
2120020437/Wonderful.
2120020438/As fate would have it, Lara fell in love with a human sorcerer, Cregennan of Lod. Other humans could not bear it and began persecuting them. They became outcasts, shunned by all around them. No pleas would soften the stone hearts of the cruel and merciless dh'oine.
2120020439/I jest, though there's truth in what I say. But we defeated the Order in the swamp and are gradually emerging from the forests...
2120020440/In due course...
2120020441/You're no human, Geralt... Sooner or later the Order will remind you of that.
2120020442/They're dh'oine, too, and more trouble than most. Speak.
2120020443/You must understand the importance of any artifacts. She was exceptional, someone whose loss defies words, no matter what the language...
2120020444/I felt no hatred for humans. In fact, I felt better than them. I told myself they were simply incapable of controlling their weaknesses, their flaws. I was robbed three times as often as others. Racist slogans were painted on my door in excrement.
2120020445/I once lived in a city among humans. I was honest and courteous, respected all their ridiculous customs and laws. Assimilation -- I lived that word for years, and during that time I was cheated, sneered at, on occasion beaten and robbed.
2120020446/No, Geralt, definitely not... And you, witcher? Who are you? You too have experienced human ignorance and hatred.
2120020447/Evolution makes no allowance for sterile mutants... No offense. Think about it, Geralt.
2120020448/We shall see, Geralt.
2120020449/I was doing nothing wrong. I had been lying to myself from the outset. Just as the moon will never catch the sun, so humans will never change.
2120020450/I'll answer your question if you answer mine.
2120020451/Ha ha ha! Why? I assume you don't mean ideology and the like, and you would rather hear some dark secret from deep within my soul.
2120020452/They will remain egotistical, envious, petty, and fearful of anything they don't understand - and believe me, there's plenty... Matters proceeded quickly thereafter, but that's another story.
2120020453/For years I wondered why. Was I doing something wrong? What could I do to bring peace to my life? And you know what I came to understand?
2120020454/I am glad you understand, White Wolf.
2120020455/Typical, you wish to take without giving... Your choice.
2120020456/The Druid's Grove acts as a sanctuary where I can quietly think, lay plans. My going to Vizima presents an unnecessary risk. Part of the unit inside Vizima is accomplishing plenty.
2120020457/We shall see, but we will not back down now.
2120020458/Gwyn'bleidd...
2120020459/I have bigger problems than Salamandra.
2120020460/Caedmill, Wolf. A pleasure to see you.
2120020461/The knights of the Order decimated us when we battled in the swamp. I know you had a hand in that...
2120020462/You will learn everything if you agree to help. I sent a unit there, but I fear something has gone wrong. I need you to find out what happened.
2120020463/I still hope you'll come to understand who you are and choose the righteous path...
2120020464/A pity. I'll wait.
2120020465/Three hundred orens. And forget what you saw, dh'oine.
2120020466/Caedmil. Thank you for your help, Wolf.
2120020467/You're a traitor and a fool.
2120020468/Why are you still here?
2120020469/Yes, all - even humans. And that in spite of their being no more sophisticated than pigs and cows. Just think what awaits the world when they finally succeed in destroying all that is beautiful and good.
2120020470/My brother, my kin - fate has torn us asunder,&#13;
2120020471/You're a fool, and clearly my foe.
2120020472/At him!
2120020473/The forests cry, the earth wails, the world trembles in fire... Behind two hostile ramparts, stand you and I.
2120020474/Two centuries ago, she led us into battle, a beautiful, honorable battle. She was slain by humans, but the vision of her has never died, the white rose of Shaerrewaedd blooms still...
2120020475/The forests cry, the earth wails, the world trembles in fire... Behind two hostile ramparts, stand you and I.
2120020476/My brother, my kin - fate has torn us asunder,&#13;
2120020477/I had a reason for telling you about Aelirenn. There's a war on, Geralt. A war for survival, for freedom. You don't have to be one of us to help us. Many serve our cause as best they can. And you're best at slaying monsters...
2120020478/Two centuries ago, she led us into battle, a beautiful, honorable battle. She was slain by humans, but the vision of her has never died, the white rose of Shaerrewaedd blooms still...
2120020479/I expect nothing more. Sorry, no time to celebrate. We're stuck here because of monsters...
2120020480/You killed elves. You killed our people. What does that get you?
2120020481/The Scoia'tael are freedom fighters. Do you understand what that means? This is a struggle for survival, for equal rights, for what is due to all living beings.
2120020482/You can't straddle the fence forever. Especially if that fence runs through the middle of a battle...
2120020483/Well and truly said. But we're stuck here, monsters block our way out....
2120020484/In my dreams at night, and in day before mine eyes,&#13;
2120020485/In my dreams at night, and in day before mine eyes,&#13;
2120020486/Aelirenn... the White Rose... She roused the youths to battle. They grabbed their arms and followed her into their last desperate fight. They were massacred. Mercilessly.
2120020487/Hmm... Have you made your decision?
2120020488/No, dh'oine. You chose for me when you raised your arm against us.
2120020489/That's true. Help us and no one else will be hurt.
2120020490/Do you wish to live in that world? We are the alternative. We have no desire to destroy the human race, we just want to survive...
2120020491/Go, White Wolf.
2120020492/Aelirenn. You know the story of Aelirenn, witcher?
2120020493/The white rose of Shaerrawedd, known to dwarves and humans as Eliren. Two centuries ago she led the elven youth into battle. Our elders were against it, knowing that success was out of reach. Knowing they might not recover from defeat...
2120020494/That depends on you, witcher. If you help us, we'll walk away and no one else will be harmed.
2120020495/Our mission was to find documents that would allow Vivaldi to recover his bank. Only right, wouldn't you say? Yet we find ourselves trapped, kikimores blocking our escape. We planned to flee through the sewers.
2120020496/Bloede Dh'oine!
2120020497/Aelirenn. You know the story of Aelirenn, witcher?
2120020498/Aelirenn. You know the story of Aelirenn, witcher?
2120020499/They died saying her name, repeating her call, her cry, they died for Shaerrawaedd... and for Aelirenn. Just as she had promised - with dignity, heroically, with honor.
2120020500/Oh, stop deceiving yourself, Geralt. You're a mutant, humans treat you like a necessary evil at best. Fighting for them, you fight against yourself and all the elder races.
2120020501/You expect gratitude from them? You expect them to call the dogs off and stop throwing stones at you? They'll show no mercy and slay you the first opportunity they get.
2120020502/Know the story of Aelirenn?
2120020503/No, with your conscience you're hardly suited to be a revolutionary.
2120020504/Ah, the famous neutrality! A little late for that, you should've stayed outside.
2120020505/You must choose, now.
2120020506/You're a fool, witcher. It's too late for neutrality. Stand with me now or forever be my foe.
2120020507/Look out. The kikimores are everywhere.
2120020508/Something's not right here, witcher.
2120020509/Problem solved. That little foray was impressive.
2120020510/Thanks. We won't forget your assistance.
2120020511/If you ever need me, ask Vivaldi.
2120020512/I'll get the documents to Vivaldi. Maybe he can take the bank back.
2120020513/Vizima is heavily guarded... but for you I'll find a way. See you there, Wolf.
2120020514/Hmmm, I can't say I'm keen to see that happen, but since you helped me...
2120020515/They're also dh'oine, but they bother me more than most. What's your offer?
2120020516/When and where, Wolf?
2120020517/There are more kikimores in the passage!
2120020518/I'll lead the survivors to the druids' cave. They can mourn the dead there. Thanks for everything.
2120020519/I'll go back to Mahakam for awhile. I hope to tear Eudora away from the Breckenriggs...
2120020520/I'm grateful you saved some.
2120020521/We're finally out of that hell!
2120020522/Farewell.
2120020523/I'll lead them to the druids' cave.
2120020524/Geralt...
2120020525/It's perfect armor. First, dwarves mined the ore surrounded by coal and tiny diamonds. The ideal raw material.
2120020526/Three pieces remain of the armor: a spaulder, rerebrace and gauntlet. Perhaps you can recreate it. As for the elven mysticism, well... steel is steel and needs no elven riddles.
2120020527/Geralt?
2120020528/Oof, we made it.
2120020529/I just remembered something... Know the legend of witcher Raven and his armor?
2120020530/Steel, Geralt. Naturally carburized iron! The dwarves gave the ore to gnomes, master metallurgists.
2120020531/Go to the dwarven blacksmith. He's hiding somewhere in Old Vizima. I'm sure he can help.
2120020532/They reforged the iron many times. Folding and beating it took two whole months! Their tempering baths enriched the hardening steel...
2120020533/War is disgusting, Geralt. All your plans crumble, turn to manure. Remember our chat at the inn?
2120020534/Heh heh. Things'll get better again. They must.
2120020535/Listen! New mechanical solutions made this armor's joints operate differently.
2120020536/And that's not all. The elven song master Tyen'saill carved power runes into the armor. But I don't know much about that...
2120020537/The armor doesn't hinder movement!
2120020538/Impossible, dammit, im-fucking-possible...
2120020539/Hurry! Stay close to me and this witcher.
2120020540/Dammit!
2120020541/We'll get one more group.
2120020542/Dammit, they were supposed to be here! Maybe they're hiding somewhere...
2120020543/Shush, Geralt! I'm going to imitate the roar of a polar tiger!
2120020544/Stay close! We're headed for the hospital!
2120020545/VROAORRROOARRAOOOAORRARROORRR!!!!!!
2120020546/We're here.
2120020547/When they hear an unlikely roar, they'll know it's me!
2120020548/Here they come!
2120020549/ROOOARRAOROAROAORORAR!
2120020550/What do you intend to do?
2120020551/Great! We need to gather two groups of refugees nearby. Then we'll break through to Shani's hospital. Ready?
2120020552/Glad you're here. I thought I'd have to run through the city on my own.
2120020553/No time to lose.
2120020554/Hurry!
2120020555/For now. I'll see if I can learn anything about the situation in the city.
2120020556/Stop.
2120020557/Dyabel aep arse!
2120020558/We'll be like polar tigers, fast and merciless!
2120020559/Let's break through the barricade and clear the road for the refugees!
2120020560/VROOOAAAOOORROORROORORORR!!!
2120020561/She told me when she saw you fighting for their cause, she couldn't leave Yaevinn.
2120020562/A frontal charge!
2120020563/She returned because you helped her at Murky Waters.
2120020564/Since she returned, he's been a better leader. Maybe we'll win...
2120020565/And they said White Rayla had no heart... Let's go. It'll be safer further on.
2120020566/Dammit! I almost thought she'd be getting up again...
2120020567/Do you know why Toruviel returned?
2120020568/We need to hurry.
2120020569/Chaaarge!
2120020570/Move, move, move!
2120020571/There they are, on the right!
2120020572/Concentrate on the combat!
2120020573/A barricade! A bit of magic might help...
2120020574/That was tough... Toruviel must be on the left flank!
2120020575/We must get through here! Geralt!
2120020576/Don't need to hear that twice! VROOORORAOROOROORAAAR!
2120020577/Watch out! Monsters!
2120020578/What are you doing here?
2120020579/Ah, you're in time for quite a scrap.
2120020580/She's organized a kind of field hospital. She mentioned you...
2120020581/All quiet at the front, here they clash, there they grunt, and again all quiet at the front. Yaevinn won. Almost all Vizima's nonhumans took up arms.
2120020582/We need to repel the attacking knights. Then I want to lead the civilians and Shani's patients out of Old Vizima.
2120020583/Go away, you're aggravating my allergy.
2120020584/When the Order started killing women and children, even the most assimilated elves rebelled. Dumbest move since the age of King Dezmod. ...
2120020585/AAAAAAAAchoo!!!!
2120020586/Aaaaaachooo!!!!
2120020587/What's going on?! Kids are orphaned one day and killed the next! Your precious Order is slaughtering women, children, civilians, everyone!
2120020588/Aaaaachoo!!! Allergies still bothering me. Here's what Shani said:
2120020589/She organized a kind of field hospital at the old town hall. Coming with me?
2120020590/As if that wasn't enough, rumors surfaced about nonhumans being resettled in Old Vizima because we're more susceptible to plague. Fucking fairy tale, of course.
2120020591/Naaah, I'm just allergic to bastards!
2120020592/Damn the BASTARDS!!!!!
2120020593/"Zoltan, how can a witcher be so stupid? Those murdering knights could've spared the civilians."
2120020594/Virtually all nonhumans have taken up arms. Turns out they trapped healthy nonhumans with sick humans in Old Vizima, to finish us with the plague!
2120020595/Fuckin' Order of the fuckin' Rose!
2120020596/Enough!!!
2120020597/You'll soon be picking your teeth from the ground!
2120020598/I spit on you!
2120020599/I'm getting very angry!
2120020600/Kiss my arse, bastards!
2120020601/They'll park a carriage in your arse when I'm done!
2120020602/I've no need.
2120020603/Bastard!
2120020604/Take it back.
2120020605/Good seeing you.
2120020606/Greetings.
2120020607/True sharps are hard to find, but games with them become legendary.
2120020608/Now it's only Vivaldi's by name.
2120020609/Witchers will always be needed, no matter where that pig herd leads us.
2120020610/You can now play for really big coin.
2120020611/The meaning of life, eh?
2120020612/You mocking me?
2120020613/Bring alcohol!
2120020614/The biggest Evil is moral relativity, which kills more than the Catriona plague and dragons combined.
2120020615/Where you find all other things illegal. Near the Hairy Bear.
2120020616/Used to be Vivaldi, but now Declan Leuvaarden's your man. That guy shits gold.
2120020617/No problem.
2120020618/Hardly something to laugh about...
2120020619/Yes?
2120020620/Don't be surprised if someone doesn't want to play with you. Real bigwigs will only deal with professionals.
2120020621/One who wins at least four professional games. Do that and you'll be welcome at every table.
2120020622/Nicely put, but as young Cerro said to King Vridank on their first date: "Does it have any practical uses?"
2120020623/Progress is like a herd of pigs. The herd brings many benefits, but no one should wonder at the all the shit.
2120020624/Ever considered marriage, Geralt?
2120020625/At her place?
2120020626/Really?
2120020627/Monsters are threatening the landing in the swamp. Everyone keeps complaining.
2120020628/Witcher!
2120020629/New owners, humans...
2120020630/It was the right thing to do.
2120020631/Contact Leuvaarden. He's usually on the dike, supervising the loading and unloading of goods.
2120020632/I haven't seen her for some time and I'm getting jealous. She-dwarves are so desirable.
2120020633/What, me, a simple dwarf?
2120020634/Congratulations! You're a virgin no more. Now you'll play for real.
2120020635/You see, I'm having doubts...
2120020636/If you want a scholar's word read Vysogota of Corvo.
2120020637/What's eating you?
2120020638/Don't make me angry, 'cause I smack hard when I'm riled. It's the Good you spoke of.
2120020639/All right... Silver-plated blade, a steel core. Suited to a two-handed grip. Decent workmanship, not perfect. I don't know runes for shit...
2120020640/Let me tell you something, witcher. Once we lead a group of women and children through a war-torn land. They slowed us down. We had to feed them, protect them, and we had to hide in the woods to pee instead of pissing by the road. In short, they were a burden, and ungrateful at that. Know why we helped them?
2120020641/You got inside the town okay? Plenty of work for a witcher in Vizima.
2120020642/That's progress. With more of us living longer, we can slaughter one another in the thousands.
2120020643/Nasty nonhumans will always find a way to sneak into human homes.
2120020644/Woo-hoo.
2120020645/Anger? Revenge? Some elven youth probably overdosed. A note on one of the bolts read: "White death trader." He was selling fisstech to kids, cheaper than anyone else. And you know how addictive it is...
2120020646/They feel strong now they've got arms. Some fool did business with them. I suspect Haren Brogg.
2120020647/Damn Scoia'tael. Now folk will call him a good man, saying how he helped old ladies... I sense a pogrom approaching.
2120020648/The damned shits drew up a list of enemies and they've begun eliminating them without regard for the consequences.
2120020649/What terrible times...
2120020650/Geralt, greetings!
2120020651/A show of force. They smashed a window and packed three bolts in Coleman's gut. Used dispersive bolt heads, a hav'caar specialty. And highly illegal.
2120020652/Terrible times, Geralt...
2120020653/Geralt...
2120020654/Damn. I once swore on this stone that no human would out drink me!
2120020655/Incredible, out drunk by old Geralt...
2120020656/You drunk? I'm your pal, Zoltan Chivay. Where have you been, why haven't I heard from you, what about...?
2120020657/Everyone's talking about it.
2120020658/Geralt, I don't want to talk to you.
2120020659/Ah, you don't need to tell Zoltan Chivay anything. Let's just say I'm glad to see you, though it would be nice to resolve some matters...
2120020660/Around here? Odo, he's got rich somehow. And I know Haren and Mikul play. And there's me.
2120020661/Fuck, take it. A pledge is a pledge.
2120020662/Thank you, my friend.
2120020663/Let's shoot a round. I'll show you.
2120020664/You know me, my schemes. I hope to start a modest business in Vizima, bringing in goods from Mahakam. The Brekenriggs are pressuring me...
2120020665/It's poker with dice - very entertaining. Requires less attention than cards, but it's just as exciting.
2120020666/I'm not sure how to tell you, but you died, Geralt. Five years ago, during the massacre in Rivia, I saw some scoundrel stick a pitchfork in your gut. You bled to death on a dirty street before my eyes. Or so I thought...
2120020667/And I've seen enough corpses to know... though there are the unexplained cases. From what I remember, witcher mutations significantly changed your body, but that makes it no easier to believe you survived.
2120020668/What? You'd have helped a friend in the past. What happened to you? Seeing you is like seeing a ghost...
2120020669/I certainly hope so. I made some investments during the war. As they say, money needs to move.
2120020670/Thanks for getting those hounds off my back. Wait... Geralt?! Is that you? Well I'll be damned!
2120020671/My future in-laws. I'm to wed Eudora Breckenriggs soon. But my father-in-law to be puts too much stock in material things. The Common Cause Mine, where I worked after the war, was a complete failure. I blame it on the bloody times.
2120020672/True to a witcher. Died, came back to life, nobody's seen him for five years and he wants to know if something's wrong.
2120020673/Duvelsheis!! I fought at Brenna for their kind and that's how they repay me. Damned racists! You could've helped.
2120020674/We'll talk later. I'm busy now.
2120020675/Hm. Know what, Geralt? Let's have a beer and talk like we used to. Clear your mind and maybe some things will come back to you.
2120020676/Join? Geralt, it's not a sect. Ask around, though professionals aren't likely to waste time playing novices.
2120020677/Win a few times and word will get around. You need to get three-four games under your belt. You'll get the idea.
2120020678/They're all small fries 'sides me. But don't fret, I'll give you an edge. The real action is in Vizima.
2120020679/Yes, a nasty matter. My friend was to meet me in this village some time ago, but he never appeared.
2120020680/I hope not, but I wouldn't be surprised if he were. He joined the Squirrels recently and agreed to trade with the hawkers.
2120020681/The Squirrels, or Scoia'tael as they call themselves, are nonhumans who hope to gain equality by shooting folk from behind trees. And hawkers are merchants who sell arms to the Scoia'tael - illegally.
2120020682/It's a theory... The strongest curses, magical beasts, and spells arise from a mixture of love, blood, destiny, and suffering...
2120020683/Geralt, I'm not exactly welcome here. We nonhumans get blamed for everything from the plague through the Beast to the warts on the Reverend's arse. I'd look for my friend myself otherwise.
2120020684/They're nonhuman little shits who were fed romantic tales. They've taken up arms to fight for freedom and other ideals. During the war with Nilfgaard, Emhyr used them to wreak havoc in the kingdoms. I don't know who supports them now.
2120020685/Dice are a dwarven invention. Became popular after the war - not surprising given that every mercenary played.
2120020686/It's no regular monster. A curse or something. Like that crap about spilt blood, love, and destiny.
2120020687/Fortunately, this is a rare combination.
2120020688/You'd be surprised how popular it is. Fortunes have been made and lost. There are those who take it very seriously, indeed.
2120020689/Leave me be, or you'll be sorry!
2120020690/We'll talk at the tavern.
2120020691/By the spider's hairy balls! I know.
2120020692/He was your friend and could pull red-hot horseshoes from the hearth without burning his bare hands.
2120020693/Caleb Stratton!
2120020694/Aaaa... hard question, Dandelion. The old times'll never come back...
2120020695/Shani's asleep... let's have a drink, then leave.
2120020696/Aaaa, that old prick... You look and you're uncertain if he's alive or stuffed. He hardly ever moves, which is good because he farts every time he does. It's impossible to understand him when dried borscht glues his beard and moustache together. But he rules Mahakam with an iron fist and we all dance to his song...
2120020697/The geopolitical situation, dear, nothing else. Mahakam means steel and not just any steel. There's also untouched coal deposits and magnetite ores. Anywhere else and you'll find pine underbrush. If anyone raises a hand against us, we'll destroy our workshops and flood our mines. Then you humans can fight it out with oak clubs, flint, and donkey jaws.
2120020698/Zoltan Chivay, miss. It's been a while, Dandelion! Greetings, Geralt.
2120020699/I've a hankering for good booze.
2120020700/Pour a round, Geralt.
2120020701/Booze is best, I always say.
2120020702/My Eudora and I have oft downed a jug and observed no effects.
2120020703/Quality booze is also used in modern medical treatments, which Shani will confirm.
2120020704/Not only. It warms the body, alleviates pain, and overcomes weakness...
2120020705/Cheers.
2120020706/Buuuurrrrrpp!
2120020707/True, but not because of the old man.
2120020708/Any success?
2120020709/We've bread, but we shouldn't eat plain bread.
2120020710/You hungry?
2120020711/Mmmm... How about sugar?
2120020712/Dwarves are no masters of stealth, Shani wouldn't sneak about and Dandelion, well, he'd mess up.
2120020713/That mummy downstairs must have a full larder...
2120020714/Fine, lard will do.
2120020715/Go for it!
2120020716/Let him play!
2120020717/There's a bit left at the bottom of the bottle. One for the road!
2120020718/Besides, they won't let me in, I'm a filthy nonhuman...
2120020719/Simply put, he cannot decide. I assume the dissonance relates to...
2120020720/Gimme a break, Dandelion. Geralt is a professional. If he says they were vampires, they were vampires. Somehow I don't feel up to any whorehouse capers...
2120020721/I understand Geralt, if Eudora found out... Believe me, you don't want to get in the way of a mad dwarf woman...
2120020722/Hm, no, I guess I see your point...
2120020723/One for the road...
2120020724/Do they have dwarf women there?
2120020725/Only a fool has no doubts, hmmpf!
2120020726/Greetings, Dandelion, Geralt. Our monster slayer looks bitter. Something happen?
2120020727/Don't bullshit me about destiny, Geralt. I realized long ago that all those pathetic bits by Itlina and the like are the same crap and humbug as those dissonances...
2120020728/Let me explain, Dandelion. Just because a woman doesn't say it, doesn't mean she doesn't want it. In fact, they often say they want something, when they really want the opposite...
2120020729/Right. The family is, hmmph, the fundamental unit of society, hmmph... Screw it all, I've got the hiccups...
2120020730/Mm-ugh, let's have another drink. I can't throw these damned hiccups.
2120020731/Damn all dissonances!
2120020732/Serious problems require serious solutions. Half-measures get you nowhere.
2120020733/Troubled times...
